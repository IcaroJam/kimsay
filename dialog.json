		"\"I'm sorry the fundamental laws of the universe don't seem to agree with you, detective, but the fact remains that it's too dark to see in here without the flashlight...\"",
		"\"Right. Now let's get to it,\" the lieutenant nods.",
		"\"I've got one in the Kineema's toolbox. We should go back for it before we continue. No sense in tripping around in the darkness.\"",
		"\"Yes,\" the lieutenant says. \"You might even call it a *feature* of the universe, that you need to *hold* tools to *use* them.\"",
		"\"So come on. We've got work to do.\"",
		"\"And the flashlight works a lot better if you *hold it in your hand*.\"",
		"\"This would be a lot easier with a flashlight...\"",
		"1 dmg to volition",
		"Told you that you *needed* those chaincutters. Everything is connected. Everything has a purpose.",
		"\"I suppose you could be impersonating him. You could have gotten the insignia from the black market or forged it. But for now I am going to set those possibilities aside. I'm not from the Inspectorate General.\"",
		"\"No need for derogatory terms. They are only doing their job.\"",
		"He nods.",
		"He nods.",
		"\"I was to meet a detective from Precinct 41 at the Whirling-in-Rags who arrived here three days ago. I am told that that is how long you have been here. Besides, you match his description.\" He looks you over.",
		"\"Regardless, I would also suggest that you locate your blazer with your official insignia.\" He points to the white rectangle on his sleeve.",
		"\"...where it has been hanging for seven days straight. We should go there as soon as we're done talking to the owner.\"",
		"\"Oh...\" There's a moment's pause, then he continues, carefully: \"If you didn't have your badge then that would be very *bad*. You would need to report it on my shortwave. But since you *do* have it, we can go straight to the task at hand.\"",
		"A bespectacled man in an orange bomber jacket is tapping his foot on the floor. Looks like he's waiting for someone -- you.",
		"\"Hello, I'm Kim Kitsuragi.\" His grip is firm. \"Lieutenant, Precinct 57. You must be from the 41st...\"",
		"\"Okay. We'll have time for that after we take a look at the coroner's case.\"",
		"\"We all feel that way sometimes. There is no such thing as a *police officer*, I'm afraid. What remains is that there is a dead body in the tree -- someone has to figure out who put it there. If we don't, no one else will.\"",
		"\"Yes.\"",
		"\"Have you removed the dead body from the tree?\"",
		"You realize he is waiting for your name.",
		"\"Yes. But I am not them. I'm from Criminal Investigation.\"",
		"\"Yes. But I am not them. I'm from Criminal Investigation.\"",
		"\"After it's been up in a tree for that long, any kind of ripping is inadvisable.\"",
		"\"Yes, well...\" He doesn't even process what you just said, just moves on.",
		"\"So, the body is still in the tree...\"",
		"\"Mm-hmm.\"",
		"\"Internal affairs. And I'm not them. I'm from Criminal Investigation.\"",
		"\"You may have murdered the man I was supposed to meet and are now impersonating him. You may be his twin, stepping in for his even more incapacitated brother out of loyalty and love.\"",
		"\"No, I don't think so.\" He studies you briefly. \"We should ask him for a run-down of the area now that I'm here as well. I understand the scene is out back, right?\"",
		"\"It also wouldn't hurt to assure him the police are finally here. In full force, I mean. Have you mapped out the initial interviews?\"",
		"\"I can see you drank last night, and the night before,\" he says after a moment of silence. \"And that you are still drunk now. But I have seen officers go through worse. Much worse.\"",
		"\"Sure. But did you take it down from the tree?\"",
		"\"They're not *just* white rectangles. They bear a halogen watermark with the letters RCM and a pattern resembling the street grid of Revachol West. I could step into the headlights of my Kineema and show you, but right now I just need you to do your job.\"",
		"\"You seem a little unsure, officer. Have you spent too much time undercover lately?\" He cracks an uneasy smile to let you know it's a joke.",
		"\"However, I would also suggest that you locate your blazer with your official insignia.\" He points to the white rectangle on his sleeve.",
		"A bespectacled man in an orange bomber jacket is tapping his foot on the floor. Looks like he's waiting for someone -- you.",
		"\"Okay, then.\" He processes the information, then disregards it.",
		"\"I was sent here to meet a detective from Precinct 41. You have the insignia of the Citizens Militia on your sleeve and on your back.\" He points to your jacket.",
		"A bespectacled man in an orange bomber jacket has folded up his newspaper and is now tapping his foot on the floor. Looks like he's been waiting for quite some time.",
		"\"Very well. Officer...\" He's slightly confused.",
		"You realize he is waiting for your name.",
		"\"It looks like we had a little scheduling error on Sunday. Saturday too, actually... Have you had time to talk to the manager here?\"",
		"\"Good. But even if you haven't, we'll have time for that after we take a look at the coroner's case.\"",
		"\"No need for derogatory terms. They are only doing their job.\"",
		"As you approach, he narrows his eyes and extends his hand in greeting.",
		"\"Then we should ask him for a run-down of the area, get me up to speed. I understand the scene is out back, right?\"",
		"\"Yes, of course.\"",
		"\"You mean you don't have a badge?\"",
		"\"Internal affairs. And I'm not them. I'm from Criminal Investigation.\"",
		"A bespectacled man in an orange bomber jacket has folded up his newspaper and is now tapping his foot on the floor. Looks like he's been waiting for quite some time.",
		"\"At the 57th, we like to prepare an initial list of persons of interest and then just... skim the surface.\" He gestures with his fingers. \"Prepare the field, get to know the players. You don't do that? Maybe it's not an inter-district practice...\"",
		"\"If you need something for your headache, there is a general store nearby. But, as I said, the dead body should be our number one concern.\"",
		"\"They're not *just* white rectangles. They bear a halogen watermark with the letters RCM and a pattern resembling the street grid of Revachol West.\"",
		"\"After you, officer.\"",
		"After catching your attention, he narrows his eyes and extends his hand in greeting.",
		"\"Hello, I'm Kim Kitsuragi.\" He looks unfazed. \"Lieutenant, Precinct 57. You must be from the 41st...\"",
		"\"Right, and the interviews?\" He taps his foot -- more out of habit than impatience.",
		"\"Does that mean the body is no longer in the tree?\"",
		"\"Completely? Does that mean you took the body down from the tree?\"",
		"\"Sure. Though I would also suggest that you locate your blazer with your official insignia.\" He points to the white rectangle on his sleeve.",
		"\"Losing your identification card is a *serious* matter. My vehicle has a shortwave -- you can use it to report your badge missing. I advise you to try to locate it as quickly as possible. But getting the body down should still take precedence.\"",
		"\"Oh...\" There's a moment's pause, then he continues, obviously relieved: \"If you didn't have your badge then that would be very *bad*. You would need to report it on my shortwave. But since you *do* have it, we can go straight to the task at hand.\"",
		"\"Losing your identification card is a *serious* matter. My vehicle has a shortwave -- you can use it to report your badge missing. I would advise you to locate it as quickly as possible. But getting the body down should still take precedence.\"",
		"\"I would ask you to step into the headlights of my motor carriage, but, again, it's none of my concern. I just need you to do your job.\"",
		"\"But for now I am going to set those possibilities aside. I'm not from the Inspectorate General.\"",
		"\"But first we have to take it down,\" he concludes.",
		"\"If you don't mind, we should talk to him again. Ask him for a run-down of the area -- now that I'm here as well. I understand the scene is out back, right?\"",
		"\"You mean you don't have a badge?\"",
		"\"Talk to the manager. Then we go out back and take the body down.\"",
		"\"Precinct 41 said they were sending their most seasoned detective. And you certainly look... seasoned.\"",
		"\"Right... Now, I know it took us a while to arrive at the scene. It also took you a while to call us and report the dead body -- it *was* you who placed the call, yes?\"",
		"\"That's good. But there is a timetable for this investigation, dictated to us by the stages of decomposition. And it says we need to move on.\"",
		"\"I am Kim Kitsuragi from Precinct 57. This is an inter-district investigation, so joining me from Precinct 41...\" He looks to you, realizing he still doesn't know your name.",
		"\"You said you just got here -- from where? Are you a local?\"",
		"\"No, don't, there's no need...\" A pattern of creases appears on his forehead. \"You really need to take this up with your station, I have a shortwave radio in my car. Call them, ask for assistance. We have to get this investigation started now.\"",
		"\"Forty one,\" the lieutenant steps in.",
		"\"Officer...\" A pattern of creases appears on his forehead. \"You really need to take this up with your station, I have a shortwave radio in my car. Call them, ask for assistance. We have to get this investigation started now.\"",
		"\"Let's go.\"",
		"He turns to you, calmly. \"We do not need to assert ourselves here. We only need instructions from him. This is the proprietor, remember?\"",
		"The lieutenant stands motionless, his expression unreadable.",
		"\"Did the Débardeurs themselves tell her this, or is it a rumour?\"",
		"\"I didn't imply that.\" He turns to you. \"Detective?\"",
		"\"Yes, Detective Costeau.\" He says the name with a purposefully straight face. \"I have everything. You?\"",
		"\"Mhm.\" He checks his little notebook. \"I have everything. You?\"",
		"\"I know it took us a while to arrive at the scene. But it also took you a while to call us. It was you who placed the call, correct?\"",
		"\"Sir, I understand your concern, but we're here to do a job, and for us to do it, I need you to stay calm.\"",
		"\"Sir, leash in your tongue.\" The lieutenant's voice is controlled, yet threatening. Like it's coming from a different person.",
		"\"Okay...\" The lieutenant lets out a heavy sigh. \"Let's go. Goodbye, sir.\"",
		"The lieutenant nods at you affirmatively, then glances at the exit. \"The body was behind the building, right -- how do we get there?\"",
		"\"Officer,\" he turns to you. \"You need to contact your station. Ask your people for assistance with the money you owe this place. There is a shortwave radio in my car, when you get the time, use it. We need to get this investigation started now.\"",
		"There's a shuffle of nylon as Lieutenant Kitsuragi looks for something in the pockets of his orange bomber.",
		"The lieutenant turns the page in the little notebook he's been scribbling in.",
		"The lieutenant watches you fiddle with your horrific tie, sweat stains forming under your armpits. He puts his hand on your shoulder.",
		"\"No, there's no need...\" The lieutenant is silent for a moment. \"Let's go. Goodbye, sir.\"",
		"\"That's enough.\" You can't tell who the remark is aimed at, you or Garte.",
		"\"That's enough now, sir. Good day.\"",
		"\"If you don't have the money, it's okay. None of us are in this for the wages.\"",
		"\"I have everything. You?\" He looks in his little notebook.",
		"The lieutenant looks at you tugging on your garish tie. He puts his hand on your shoulder:",
		"There's a shuffle of nylon as Lieutenant Kitsuragi looks for something in the pockets of his orange bomber.",
		"\"I'm sorry I couldn't help more.\" Creases line his forehead, above the spectacles. \"You should take this up with your station, I have a shortwave radio in my car, okay? We have to get this investigation started now.\"",
		"\"Mr... Garte, right?\" The lieutenant glances into his little notebook. \"You run this place?\"",
		"\"Officer, maybe you're better off working this from home for now? You live in Jamrock, right? It's not that far away.\"",
		"\"Khm...\" The lieutenant coughs in your direction. \"Not now.\"",
		"\"You mean the strike?\"",
		"\"But you still know your way around, yes? In case we need directions.\"",
		"\"It is crude of you. A man has been killed. File a request for compensation with Station 41. We need to work now.\"",
		"\"And how do we get there?\"",
		"\"Do you have her number?\"",
		"\"Thank you,\" the lieutenant says. He opens his little notebook at the cover. The number is safely tucked away in a small pocket.",
		"\"Officer... I was thinking more along the lines of your name.\"",
		"\"It's your turn.\" He takes a respectful little step back.",
		"\"Some do take recompense.\" The lieutenant is dead serious. \"But only to survive.\"",
		"\"But, you see, he didn't.\"",
		"\"There's a greenhouse here -- and a gardener with a wheelbarrow on the corner of the Whirling-in-Rags. If she works here she might have something for the smell.\"",
		"\"No. This is a two-man assignment, because it needs two officers to complete. I need your help.\" He withdraws his hand and looks you in the eye:",
		"\"Officer, you just need to be stronger. Learn to keep it in long enough for us to work. There's nothing else *to* do.\"",
		"\"By *ka-ching* do you mean...\" He tilts his head. \"'Let's not log them as evidence, let's steal them'?\"",
		"\"Did we? I don't *feel* lucky.\"",
		"\"There's always a chance. We should check for ligament marks on his neck to see if they're in tune with the belt. We'll have to get him *down* first...\"",
		"\"No, you're right. The harbour uses six-rotors to shuffle containers around. They used whatever was on hand here. Without paying attention to not incriminating themselves.\"",
		"\"There are no supra-natural reasons,\" the lieutenant says, marking something in his notebook.",
		"\"And what kind of lesson is that?\" Just like that the gun has left your hand. The lieutenant holsters it.",
		"The gun has left your hand, still numb from the recoil. The lieutenant holsters it under his arm.",
		"\"There's the Frittte nearby -- maybe they have some in their apothecary? If they don't...\" He points to the greenhouse.",
		"\"A good point. He could have been intoxicated. Or something we cannot yet imagine... I shouldn't have assumed so much just from the clothes.\"",
		"\"They do after seven days, yes. We're deep in decomposition here.\"",
		"\"Monday -- make sure you bring a handkerchief.\"",
		"\"They're armour, not boots.\" With his notebook under his arm the lieutenant crouches to inspect the soles: \"Technically speaking these are *sabatons*.\"",
		"\"There's no way you're getting them off. All the organic matter in his body has been flowing down into the boots. They're *fused* to his feet now -- why do you think the locals haven't scavenged them yet?\"",
		"\"It *does* make sense, doesn't it? Besides...\" The lieutenant taps on the boot.",
		"\"As I said it's been below freezing since last Sunday. Today is the first chance to thaw. Things would be... *worse* if it had thawed earlier.\"",
		"\"An instant colour camera.\" He produces two metal-capped ampoules and clicks them into place on the side of the apparatus. A thin slot shines there...",
		"\"Hmh... The steel-reinforced belt presents a *unique* challenge. I brought chain-cutters, but I don't see a good angle of approach to the belt.\"",
		"\"I don't doubt your physical prowess, officer, but this is a gruelling surgical procedure. I saw twenty steel strands in there -- and we do not have a secure platform for the cutting.\"",
		"\"I think you have your sports mixed up there, officer, squaring my shoulders has nothing to do with this.\"",
		"\"Go ahead, I'm not stopping you. Just don't lose it.\" The piece shines in his outstretched hand.",
		"The lieutenant follows suit. He finishes loading the gun in silence, then hands it to you.",
		"\"*Extremely* unfortunate. You need to contact your station about it as soon as possible.\" The piece shines in his outstretched hand. \"Try not to lose this one, please.\"",
		"\"We still need to get him down *somehow*.\" His tone is growing tired now -- the stench makes him turn away from the corpse.",
		"\"Everything here seems to corroborate that assumption. But we should still get him *down* before assigning a probable cause of death.\"",
		"\"To ask the *suspects* for help with the victim's body? To be indebted to Evrart Claire? Very much, yes -- which is why I would have preferred us to handle this ourselves.\"",
		"\"Okay...\" He looks at the cargo belt. \"They *do* have the tools and the men. And since it looks like they *put* him there...\"",
		"\"Yes.\" He agrees. \"The debrief we got from the Wild Pines representative appears to be solid too. A lynching is what this looks like. Our internal RCM brief said the same...\" He looks at you.",
		"\"No, I think he had something precious underneath his clothes. They had to remove the *jeans* we found in the trash to get to it. This kind of armour is often worn *under* fabric.\"",
		"\"There's Frittte nearby, east of the hostel. They usually have a small apothecary. If they don't...\" He points to the greenhouse.",
		"\"I think I've lost my sense of smell.\" There's a pause.",
		"\"Yes, that's what I said. You'll compromise the coroner's case if you do. So please *don't*.\"",
		"\"Even the mongrels can see you're about to pull his head off.\"",
		"\"This is not the *enemy*, this is the deceased. The victim. In a murder investigation.\"",
		"\"No. You should *not* get a drink. You should perform an initial inspection of the victim's corpse -- we're on the rope part.\"",
		"\"Then you should ask me the first moment we get.\"",
		"\"Agreed.\" He points to the belt. \"Especially on the neck. The belt acted like a tourniquet keeping the blood in his head. The hypostasis supports a hanging.\"",
		"\"Climb up there and... saw the branch?\"",
		"\"I think you're underestimating the gravity of this situation, officer. We need to take a breather from this scene.\" He points at you. \"Now.\"",
		"\"At least you understand the gravity of the situation, detective. We need to take a breather from this scene.\" He points at you. \"Now.\"",
		"\"The *bad* way -- the way I didn't want us to.\" He sighs. \"By asking the harbour for help. They have the tools and the men. If they put him up there -- they can take him down too.\"",
		"\"No?\" The lieutenant's expression is stern and impenetrable. He points at you: \"You *will* get your shit together.\"",
		"\"I have no idea what that means.\"",
		"\"This material is a kinetic re-distributor. It spreads kinetic energy horizontally. From plate to plate. When the plates connect there's a click.\" He points to the toe. \"See these lines?\"",
		"\"Stop obsessing about your sexuality officer, you're about to seriously compromise the coroner's case.\"",
		"\"I don't think we should *do* anything just for the hell of it. Besides...\" The lieutenant taps on the boot.",
		"\"We should have a look at that belt before we even *consider* taking him down. It looks worrisome.\" (He points to the belt around his neck.)",
		"\"I have only a cursive knowledge of the science of cybernetics -- I would not know if it were. But it's not *quite* complex enough, is it?\"",
		"\"I agree.\" A sudden ring fills the air as the lieutenant pulls down the zipper of his orange jacket.",
		"\"Yes...\" He slides the camera closed and tucks it away on his belt. \"It is pretty *cool*, isn't it?\"",
		"\"I don't trust that ladder. The assailants didn't use it. It's rotten and less sturdy than it looks. And I don't see another good way up there.\"",
		"He then steps back and assumes the Falostesse position, taking aim. The corner of his eye twitches -- his finger is on the trigger...",
		"\"Don't provoke her.\" The lieutenant takes his sidearm from you, then holsters it.",
		"\"I can't say I'm *fully* satisfied with that part. We should search for prints maybe...\" He points to the spring mud around you.",
		"\"Four and final: transport of the coroner's case to the district morgue. I'll do that.\" The lieutenant stops. \"God, he stinks.\"",
		"\"Yes...\" He nods slowly. \"And those were the interviewees. Let's go.\"",
		"\"Sure you do. You just threw up *a lot*.\"",
		"\"As a wage, it's regrettably small. But for a piece of hardware -- yes, that's a lot.\"",
		"\"No.\" He shakes his head. \"Your first instinct was correct. This equipment is way beyond what a security guard can afford.\"",
		"\"Stop!\" The lieutenant's voice is sharp. He looks at you, with the boot under your arm.",
		"\"I do. Most of them are postmortem. Maybe even all of them. The delinquents have made our jobs harder with their little sport.\"",
		"\"Airlifting? I thought it was used on lorries -- for strapping cargo to them.\"",
		"\"That ladder can't carry a grown man. I didn't see any splintering either, did you? I think they lassoed the branch, then pulled on the belt to close the buckle...\" He makes a pulling motion.",
		"\"A map of the stars?\" He turns around to breathe before inspecting it closer. \"I do see some similarity to astronomical charts, Great Century Messinian maybe... But this seems more particular. Customized somehow.\"",
		"\"In case we need it,\" the lieutenant says and shakes the paper, letting it dry in the cold wind. On it -- a colour-perfect copy of the dead man's tattooed chest.",
		"\"Hmm...\" The lieutenant marks something in his notebook.",
		"\"I wasn't actually implying I would. I meant it's a bad idea.\"",
		"\"What else can we do?\"",
		"\"God damn it.\"",
		"\"I agree. Police work is overrated. It is trying and stressful. However, it is still our job to get the dead body down from the tree.\" He takes his sidearm from you and holsters it.",
		"\"The cadaver is already compromised bad enough. We don't have to make it *worse*.\"",
		"\"I'm satisfied with that part. The trash container, the prints -- we've been thorough enough.\"",
		"\"Two: Initial examination of the victim. We were pretty good in our efforts -- and the autopsy will provide another chance.\"",
		"\"Three: Field autopsy. This will *not* be pleasant. Or easy. And it *will* have to be performed on the scene.\"",
		"\"An honour -- and a burden. Attached to your rank. Mine is *lieutenant-detective* -- unfortunately. I can't tell you how tired I am of this corpse...\"",
		"\"In the meantime, we should locate the representative of the logistics company. My preliminary information suggests the Wild Pines have sent a strike negotiator to wrangle back control from the Union.\"",
		"\"If you can handle the headache,\" he nods. \"Some officers use it to deal with cadaverine odour.\"",
		"\"It's anything but. This material is a kinetic re-distributor. It spreads kinetic energy horizontally, from plate to plate. Dissipating it entirely.\" He points to the boots. \"See?\"",
		"\"I'm sorry. I didn't even want to take them off, I just thought I should try.\"",
		"The lieutenant's face is made of stone.",
		"\"We all are.\" He covers his nose. \"This belt worries me.\"",
		"\"I have only two ampoules, so nobody move -- I don't want to waste one.\" He points the camera at the corpse, peering into it. The lens needs adjusting. Then:",
		"\"Absolutely.\"",
		"\"Honestly, I prefer a *non-acrobatic* solution to this.\" He looks around -- then at you.",
		"\"What I'm proposing is -- we save acrobatic tricks as a last resort. After we've tried *everything* else.\"",
		"\"We try something else.\"",
		"\"No.\"",
		"\"It looks like *I* feel like taking a break from the stench. I'm sorry to interrupt the jubilations here -- just a little breather before we do the autopsy.\"",
		"\"The stench is getting bad. I'm sorry to interrupt the jubilations here -- I need a little breather before we do the autopsy.\"",
		"\"Two: Initial examination of the victim. We were not exhaustive in our efforts, should have looked at the tattoos maybe? But what's done is done.\"",
		"\"Good.\"",
		"\"The risk of... acrobatic failure is one we cannot take. We must not become *comedy* for the locals.\"",
		"\"Fine, then.\" The piece shines in his outstretched hand.",
		"The lieutenant pays no heed: \"We should go and do something else. Give it half an hour. Then come back, when you've gotten your act together.\"",
		"He breathes out heavily.",
		"\"I've seen *captains* puke their guts out. It never gets easier, you never get used to the smell. Every Monday is cadaver day -- throw up, investigate, throw up, initial autopsy, throw up, bag it...\" He pats your back again.",
		"\"No, it's not officer.\"",
		"\"Not too much, yes.\"",
		"He nods: \"Piece by piece. He's been out here for seven days -- it would be odd if they didn't.\"",
		"\"Okay. Fine. You want to protect the *feet* of six dead men. That's commendable. But...\" The lieutenant taps on the boot.",
		"\"Oh,\" he snorts. \"You're trying to assess *lividity*.\"",
		"\"Maybe it looks faint to you?\" He leans closer, covering his nose: \"It *could* be more pronounced, actually. Dûment noté.\"",
		"\"A noose is one of those things that's easier to use one way around...\" He points to the buckle tying the belt to the branch above.",
		"\"Oh, no.\" He shakes his head slowly. \"We should be *very* afraid of newspapers. And the radio stations too. We should be wary of enticing them in *any* way.\"",
		"Silence. With his elbows sharp, the lieutenant unzips his jacket...",
		"The kid's voice is drowned in a shrill blast that echoes off the walls of the surrounding tenements. A cloud of smoke slowly parts in the air, as the lieutenant steps back and says to himself...",
		"But then it does -- and with furious precision! The lieutenant is not one to leave an Ace's Low *hanging*.",
		"\"I can't say I'm satisfied with that part yet. We should search for prints maybe...\" He stops to look at the spring mud. \"And the trash container too...\"",
		"\"We need to access the harbour and ask the leader of the Union to have it taken down. They have the tools -- and they have men.\"",
		"He nods. \"Right now everything seems to fit their confession.\"",
		"\"So am I.\" A sudden ringing fills the air as the lieutenant pulls down the zipper of his orange jacket.",
		"\"I've seen strong men turn themselves inside out for hours. You're facing tough odds here. Alcohol withdrawal makes it considerably harder.\"",
		"The lieutenant nods, wiping his finger on his sleeve.",
		"\"For a full set of armour I wouldn't blame you. But these boots are hardly worth a disciplinary hearing. There are better ways to pay a hostel bill. Besides...\" He taps the boot.",
		"\"We have a make and a number -- that's something. We can use the radio in my Kineema when we're done. Either station can chase it for us.\"",
		"\"That's for us to find out. My initial report on the area suggests he was a security guard for the harbour company -- but that's just hearsay.\"",
		"\"I agree. This equipment is *way* beyond what a guard can afford.\"",
		"\"Processing will take care of them. With the situation in the morgue, it will yield nothing. But we must pick our fights.\" He looks toward the boots. \"Should we continue?\"",
		"\"Totally dead.\"",
		"\"I have thought of that, yes. But the tyre tracks would compromise the scene. Any prints would become illegible. That's *if* we get it through the hole in the fence...\"",
		"\"No, I do not see the future. I made those up using two decades in the Revacholian police force as a reference point.\"",
		"\"That is even *more* unfortunate than the badge. You need to contact your station about it as soon as possible.\" The piece shines in his outstretched hand. \"Try not to lose this one, please.\"",
		"\"Are you sure we've finished the preliminary examination of the cadaver? We might miss some of these things once he's down.\" He stops to think, then checks his notes.",
		"\"Officer, let's keep our attention on the victim.\"",
		"\"Someone could have cleaned the yard. But that's a question for... the red-haired thing.\"",
		"\"Honestly -- a whole set of ceramics: the breastplate, the pauldrons... I wouldn't blame you. But these two? Not worth bringing Internal Affairs into your life over. Besides...\" He taps the boot.",
		"\"That doesn't sound like a serial number. Where's the structure and logic of a line of manufactured products...\" He pauses to think. \"No matter. We should run it anyway.\"",
		"\"That doesn't mean anything, detective. Besides...\" The lieutenant taps on the boot.",
		"\"Just something I scraped together from my station. An area report on Martinaise. I'm sure you did the same...\"",
		"\"I see it.\" He adjusts his glasses. \"His neck too, the lividity goes right up his chin. We have good, well-pronounced discolouration here...\"",
		"\"Okay.\" He blinks. \"You should ask me for one the first moment we get.\"",
		"\"I think they lassoed the branch, then pulled on the belt -- buckle closes.\" He makes a pulling motion. \"It's what I would do. Seems easier than climbing up there.\"",
		"He takes a thin piece of milled aluminium from his coat pocket and pulls it open. Sounds like a sword being unsheathed. A small lens appears -- some sort of camera.",
		"\"Who is he? He is male, forty to fifty. With an athletic build.\"",
		"\"Hmmm...\" The lieutenant falls deep in thought.",
		"\"*Cretin Cop*... -- they like that word -- ...*Saws The Branch He's Sitting On (Literally)*. *Local Children Report Corpse Mutilation*.\"",
		"\"Yes. We should use acrobatics as the very last option. After we've tried *everything* normal.\"",
		"The lieutenant gently picks his gun from your hand and holsters it.",
		"\"That is not important right now.\"",
		"\"Ace's high!\" The lieutenant raises his right hand, waiting for you to slap it.",
		"\"We will perform a field autopsy and determine the cause of death -- but before... excuse me.\" He needs to turn away from the corpse.",
		"\"I am at a loss as well. I could *swear* your shit was together, detective.\"",
		"\"The leader of the Union. A dangerous and corrupt man. One you don't want to be *indebted* to.\"",
		"\"Then the world will turn away from you, and leave you behind.\"",
		"\"*They* usually hang them completely naked for that. La Puta Madre, the Mazda, the Besmerties, and the like. This one still has his underpants.\"",
		"\"You'd have to boil them in acid. Besides...\" The lieutenant taps on the boot.",
		"\"Yes, there's always a chance we're wrong. We should check for ligament marks on his neck to see if they're in tune with the belt. We'll have to get him *down* first...\"",
		"\"Uhm...\" He considers it: \"No. More like in a *harbour*. Like the one just east of here. I get the sense they used whatever was on hand, without paying much attention to not incriminating themselves.\"",
		"\"It's not merely polyester -- it's steel reinforced.\" He rises to inspect the noose. \"See these lines? This is where the wires run. I see rabbets for more than twenty strands.\"",
		"\"How about I take *you* piggyback?\" After a moment’s silence, he raises an eyebrow.",
		"The lieutenant does not dignify that with an answer. He snaps the button on his holster and says...",
		"There is silence.",
		"\"Okay,\" he mumbles for a second, then lowers his hand. \"Maybe it's not customary in the 41st to perform an Ace's High. In the 57th we've carried over the custom from the Revolution. Maybe it's bad luck... anyway.\"",
		"\"I see what you mean, but even so...\" The lieutenant taps on the boot.",
		"\"He worked for Krenel -- like Joyce told us. This is military equipment, provided by a wealthy security contractor. With state ties. *Way* above what we have.\"",
		"\"Mhm. It means 'disciplinary hearing'.\" The lieutenant nods, wiping his finger on his sleeve.",
		"\"Please stop trying to perform a *necromantic ritual*. We have other things to do.\"",
		"\"Hooray for us.\"",
		"\"From the gates -- by negotiating or fighting. I'm *unenthusiastic* about fighting...\" He looks around. \"Or we can try to find some secret third path -- it's unlikely, though.\"",
		"\"I was really hoping we wouldn't -- the Union appear to be *suspects* in this case. It seems like a dangerous route to go down.\"",
		"\"Yes.\" He agrees. \"The debrief we got from the Wild Pines representative appears to be solid too. A lynching is what this looks like.\"",
		"\"It's okay, happens to everyone.\" The lieutenant hands you his white handkerchief: \"Keep it.\"",
		"\"Get a hold of yourself.\" You feel the lieutenant pat your back, rhythmically.",
		"\"That's probably a good idea. Clear our heads. But before we can do that...\" He withdraws his hand from your back and looks you in the eye:",
		"\"How many clues do you need? You already found the number. Besides...\" He taps on the boot.",
		"\"I think he was upright immediately after death. Blood has gathered in his hands and feet. And his neck.\" He points to his fattened chin.",
		"He nods. \"The local harbour uses six-rotors to shuffle containers around. I get the sense they used whatever was on hand, without paying much attention to not incriminating themselves.\"",
		"\"So -- what do you think?\"",
		"\"Good. The victim is of Occidental descent,\" he scribbles in his notebook. \"Light brown hair -- blue eyes.\"",
		"\"Yes,\" he concedes. \"I am attached to it. But it's also unsuitable. We can't bring a supercharged tractor through that tiny gap in the fence, then plough the scene with it. Then fall off the roof. It would sound bad on Channel 8.\"",
		"\"We're *not* getting him down already. Not getting him down is a task that's already accomplished. Sadly, it's not our job to *keep* him up there, but to get him down.\"",
		"\"There has to be a less risky way. With less falling down off trees.\"",
		"\"It absolutely will not, officer. That's not how physics work. It will maybe cut *one* thread loose.\"",
		"\"I'll blow his head off.\"",
		"\"No, we're lucky as it is. We didn't break anything -- and the victim remains uncompromised.\" He looks around, at the windows overlooking the yard.",
		"\"Go ahead, I'm not stopping you. Just don't lose it.\" The Armistice A9 shines in his outstretched hand.",
		"\"Someone else?\" He pauses. \"You mean like... *the police*?\"",
		"\"Someone like a paid garbage man? Or a cleaning crew? I have bad news for you -- that *is* a detective.\"",
		"\"This makes getting him down much more problematic than I had assumed...\"",
		"\"Clearly we can't.\"",
		"\"By the way, when you get the chance -- *perhaps* you should ask me to share the RCM brief you. I'm pretty sure you've *forgotten* it.\"",
		"\"No,\" he says, shaking his head, \"that ladder is not climbable and I don't really see another good way up there.\"",
		"\"You need to get your shit together.\"",
		"\"For a full set -- about four years of wages.\"",
		"\"The locals probably scavenged it -- it would be odd if he had more on after *seven* days.\"",
		"\"No. He must have worn something precious underneath his clothes. They've removed all his clothes to get to it -- they did not just strip him for the putrid rags.\"",
		"\"Officer, if I may ask -- what were you trying to achieve by pulling on the deceased foot?\"",
		"\"There's no way you're getting them off. All the organic matter in his body has been flowing down into the boots. For *seven* days. They're *fused* to his feet now -- why do you think they're the only thing left on him?\"",
		"\"There's a...\" his eye twitches for a moment, \"a strong build-up of gases, yes. Rigor mortis becoming livor mortis. He'll be fully limp by tomorrow. I don't think he'll explode... I *hope* not.\"",
		"\"Yes. It looks like they used whatever was on hand, paying no attention to not incriminating themselves.\"",
		"\"I was afraid it would be...\" He rises to inspect the noose. \"Thin steel wiring, parallel strands. This makes getting him down more problematic than I had assumed...\"",
		"A sound, a shrill flash. Followed by the breaking of a small ampoule of glass. You see streams of colour pour onto the thick, glossy piece of paper rolling out.",
		"\"Daba-doop-doop-dead,\" he says without a hint of melody. Not one muscle in his face moves.",
		"\"Okay.\" The lieutenant marks something in his notebook.",
		"\"I mean white.\"",
		"\"The cadaver is a good 1.2 metres up, neither one of us can reach the belt without assistance. And even if we do, there's the question of cutting it...\"",
		"\"It's tempting. But decapitating him will make it impossible to ascertain whether he was really hung. The damage to the neck would make coronary work pointless.\"",
		"\"Try what exactly?\"",
		"\"Here -- a souvenir.\" He hands you the piece of rolled up photo paper. It's no larger than a pack of cigarettes. \"Don't lose it.\"",
		"\"*Or* we could talk to the representative of the logistics company again. I know we already met Joyce, but that didn't count as an interview. We need to ask her how the strike and lynching are *connected*.\"",
		"\"The noose acted like a tourniquet, keeping the blood in his head. The hypostasis here is in tune with a hanging. That's what I think.\"",
		"\"It's not *pity*. You should wipe your mouth after vomiting.\" He pockets the handkerchief.",
		"\"It is. It's expensive.\" The lieutenant draws a line in the condensation on the ceramic -- with his index finger.",
		"\"Under the heel. Fairweather...\" He turns the boot slightly. \"Fairweather model T-500 / VE. I'm guessing that's 'vitreous enamel'. This is advanced stuff.\"",
		"\"One way or *another?* I can't even think of the *one* way... *magic*? *Semenese corpse salt*? Besides...\" The lieutenant taps on the boot.",
		"\"Maybe.\" He doesn't *really* want to dwell on it too long.",
		"\"Industrial strength. The kind used for tying cargo to lorries.\"",
		"\"I'm still approaching this as a lynching, yes. Motivated by the ongoing strike.\" He politely raises an eyebrow: \"You?\"",
		"\"The cadaver is a good 1.2 metres up, neither one of us can reach the belt without assistance. And even if we do, there's the question of cutting the airship-strength material...\"",
		"\"Yes. It's not a good idea.\"",
		"The lieutenant remains unaffected. \"How?\"",
		"\"But... what *else* can we do?\"",
		"\"Yes.\" He covers his nose. \"The four phases of a murder scene. One: Investigation of the scene.\"",
		"\"No. You and I are *detectives*. The honorary rank of 'detective' signifies our ability to handle *the entire incident chain*. From crime scene, to autopsy, to clean-up. We do it all.\"",
		"\"In the meantime, we should try to interview Evrart Claire, the leader of the Union. Harbour property was clearly used in the hanging...\" He points to the belt. \"The harbour just east of here. Getting *in* might prove a challenge, though...\"",
		"\"An appropriate attitude.\" He withdraws his hand and looks you in the eye:",
		"\"We've requested similar material for our tactical units for years now. The Constabulary's deemed it too costly. In that time, we've lost six men to semi-automatics.\"",
		"\"Ceramic plate. Zirconium dioxide most likely. This is where the make would be...\"",
		"\"Officer, the decomposing corpse has temporarily suspended my sense of humour. Let's continue in a less playful manner.\" He pauses to think. \"Anyway...\"",
		"\"The victim appears to have contained no more than half a kilogram of digestion at the time of death.\"",
		"\"I've kept an eye on the forecast. It's been below freezing since last Sunday. Today is the first chance to thaw. Things would be... *worse* if it had thawed earlier.\"",
		"\"It contains insight to the victim's person. By his build, I'd say this was a man of physical violence. The story he wanted his body to tell was important to him. It is his letter -- to us. *Someone* should decipher it. We'll need to show it around.\"",
		"\"Why do you think so?\"",
		"\"Also, my MC has a sloped roof, it's a *sports* model.\" He makes a gesture indicating a harsh degree of sloping. \"The roof is slippery -- an all-around bad platform to stand on.\"",
		"...and produces a lightweight firearm. He drops a paper cartridge in the barrel, separates the scouring stick and gives the cartridge five tucks.",
		"\"Think of the *boys from Processing* as murderers. Only instead of people they murder crime scenes. Processing is a wrecking crew. They know how to commission off items and how to work the incinerator in the morgue.\"",
		"\"Sadly, yes. The whole RCM is out there right now, doing the exact same thing we are. Are we in a rush to help them? Not with this on our hands...\" He covers his nose.",
		"The lieutenant takes a little hop to perform the customary salutation. Your palm hurts from the slap. It's precise and down to the point.",
		"\"The leader of the Union. A dangerous and corrupt man, from what I hear -- you don't want to owe him much.\"",
		"\"I bet she has a *fresh* perspective to offer us. Since we've already talked to Evrart in the harbour -- that interview is done. For better or for worse.\"",
		"\"We should keep a lookout for these pieces. The armour could yield information.\" He nods toward the red-haired boy eyeing you suspiciously. \"This is one thing he might actually know...\"",
		"\"Not being hungover helps too.\"",
		"\"Good. Can you read it to me?\" He tips the drying ball point of his pen on his tongue.",
		"\"Maybe we should concentrate on what's outside the boot and leave what's inside to the boys at Processing? Just this once? Besides...\" He taps on the boot.",
		"\"So am I.\" A sudden ringing fills the air as the lieutenant pulls down the zipper of his orange jacket.",
		"\"It's bad as it is -- us shooting firearms like punks...\" He pauses, then shrugs and proceeds to load the pistolette...",
		"The lieutenant watches you jerk some tears, your shoulders shaking and your eyes dry. The gun begins to slip from your fingers.",
		"\"I know it's hard. But I assure you -- the others won't come to help us. And we have a *growing* sanitary concern here. We need to get him down, fast.\"",
		"\"I can't say I'm satisfied with that part yet. I still want to know what's in that trash container...\" He points to it.",
		"\"Extremely.\"",
		"\"This had better not turn into another *demonstration* of yours.\"",
		"\"I suggest we go to the harbour and ask the leader of the Union to help us with the body -- I would have preferred us not to owe the Union anything, but we clearly cannot do this ourselves. Let's go.\"",
		"\"If she doesn't have any, there might be some in the Frittte store nearby.\"",
		"\"Yes, we do.\" The lieutenant inspects the belt, his forehead is lined with worry.",
		"\"Then drive to the station, maybe throw up on the way there if you didn't bag the thing tight enough.\"",
		"\"You're going to pull his head off.\"",
		"\"You're about to pull his head off.\"",
		"\"The brief suggested as much. Politically motivated by the ongoing strike... did you not get a briefing?\"",
		"\"Yes.\" He covers his nose. \"It often is. This belt worries me.\"",
		"\"A Trigat Sunshine. Mini.\"",
		"\"No sirree.\" He shakes his head.",
		"He nods in agreement with this advanced piece of conceptualization. Having mulled it over the lieutenant says: \"That sounds about right, yes.\"",
		"\"I don't doubt your physical prowess, officer, but that's aircraft strength material. And we do not have a secure platform to perform the procedure on.\"",
		"\"Remain collegial, officer. It was an honest mistake -- and I will not repeat it.\"",
		"\"I have to say, it's beginning to look unlikely we can get him down without *assistance*.\"",
		"\"Don't.\" You feel the lieutenant's hand on your shoulder.",
		"The lieutenant gently picks his gun from your hand and holsters it.",
		"The gun has left your hand, still numb from the recoil. The lieutenant holsters it under his arm.",
		"\"I would also suggest we interview Joyce, the Wild Pines representative, but we've already done that. So -- good for us. One down, one to go.\"",
		"He sighs. \"Okay. Let's do it the lousy, dangerous way.\"",
		"\"He's a dangerous and corrupt man, and we cannot predict what he will want from us in return.\"",
		"\"Keep it.\" The lieutenant hands you a blue checkered handkerchief.",
		"\"Are you okay, officer?\" You feel the lieutenant pat you on the back. Heavy, rhythmic pats.",
		"\"Okay. You've said it. You needed to say it, and now that you have...\" He withdraws his hand from your back and looks you in the eye:",
		"\"Give it half an hour, get yourself together, then come back and have another go.\"",
		"The lieutenant is clearly at a loss.",
		"The lieutenant cups his ear: \"Did you hear that? A click?\"",
		"\"Of course.\" He nods.",
		"\"We have a make and a number -- that's something. We can use the radio in my Kineema to run it later. Either station can chase it for us.\"",
		"\"What are you trying to achieve anyway, why are you hanging on to that boot?\"",
		"\"Of no nation that I know of. If anything, it reminds me of religious illumination, last or penultimate century. Men who live harsh lives often turn to innocentic worship -- but which one? I see no trace of a humanoid figure.\"",
		"\"Who is he? He is male, forty to fifty. With an athletic build.\"",
		"\"Any more mistakes could put us in an unfortunate position with the locals. We have eyes on us. I didn't do us any favours with that.\"",
		"\"Someone already did. You know who came? We did. Because we have made bad life decisions.\"",
		"\"I did not want us to be indebted to Evrart Claire. I wanted us to be able to deal with it ourselves. That is *clearly* not the case. We need help.\"",
		"\"To purposefully mislead us.\" He nods. \"They must've hung him fast after that bullet hit. This is well done. It would have fooled *me*.\"",
		"\"It's tempting. But decapitating him *might* be against regulations.\"",
		"\"We should keep a lookout for these pieces. The armour could yield information.\" He nods toward the red-haired boy eyeing you suspiciously. \"Maybe he'll know something.\"",
		"\"I can't handle the headache.\"",
		"\"I agree.\" A sudden ring fills the air as the lieutenant pulls down the zipper of his orange jacket.",
		"\"Nor does the wind right now...\" You feel the lieutenant pat your back, rhythmically.",
		"\"We should go talk to the locals, find something else to do while the wind changes. It's pretty bad right now.\"",
		"\"Indeed...\" With his notebook under his arm the lieutenant crouches to inspect the soles: \"Technically speaking these are *sabatons*, not boots.\"",
		"\"You do understand the boots are steeped in cadaverine odour, don't you?\"",
		"\"Sure, just don't lose it.\" He hands you the piece of rolled up photo paper. It's no larger than a pack of cigarettes.",
		"\"I agree.\"",
		"\"Where?\" He corrects his glasses. \"Ah, yes. I see. If the shot hits that there *might* be a chance to release the belt...\"",
		"\"I agree.\" The lieutenant holsters the weapon with a quick move. \"Enough gunslinging for today.\"",
		"\"From the gates -- by negotiating or fighting.\" He looks up to the east. \"Or we can try the secret route we found. Where your cloak is. It looked doable.\"",
		"\"*Or* we could ask around for the representative of the logistics company. My initial information says the Wild Pines have sent some sort of *strike negotiator* to wrangle control back from Evrart.\"",
		"\"This is a kinetic re-distributor. It spreads the incoming energy horizontally, from plate to plate. When the plates connect, there's a click. That's the sound you heard.\" He points to the toe. \"See these lines?\"",
		"\"That's for us to find out.\" He checks his notes. \"Mr... Garte implied he was security personnel for the harbour company. This confirms my own assumptions.\"",
		"\"You have a point there, detective. You have a point. But...\" The lieutenant taps on the boot.",
		"\"Seventy percent of the cases I get are just filling in the blanks on the initial report.\" He covers his nose. \"This belt worries me.\"",
		"\"He is.\" He points to the corpse.",
		"\"Yes...\" He corrects his glasses. \"The buckle -- where it ties the cargo belt to the tree. If the shot hits that then there might be a small chance to release the belt...\"",
		"\"Two: Initial examination of the victim. We were *exhaustive* in our efforts there. Good job.\"",
		"\"Your station would not have assigned you the case otherwise. This case is *important*.\"",
		"\"Active decay.\" The lieutenant raises a white piece of linen to his nose. \"It's okay to throw up, officer. No one is judging.\"",
		"\"That young woman, the gardener, mentioned she used salts for the smell.\" He nods toward the plaza.",
		"\"You're facing tough odds here. It's aggravated further by alcohol withdrawal.\"",
		"\"It's a sorry situation, I agree.\"",
		"\"So they don't get shot in the foot? I think our *extremities* are fine without a dead man's boots.\"",
		"\"*Pull his head off*. There's no point performing an autopsy if you do, we'll have compromised the coroner's case.\"",
		"\"How should I know why you're squinting, officer?\"",
		"The lieutenant inspects the belt, his forehead lined with worry.",
		"\"*Clown Cops Climb Tree, Fall Down*,\" he says, furrowing his brow. \"*Enraged Cop Assaults Children -- After Falling From Tree*.\"",
		"The lieutenant's brow is furrowed. He appears too deep in concentration to even notice what you said.",
		"The lieutenant doesn't say a word, just looks at the gun in his hand.",
		"The lieutenant takes the gun carefully from you and holsters it. His eyes are narrow and he doesn't comment on your antics.",
		"\"It's bad as it is -- us shooting firearms like punks here...\" He pauses, then shrugs: \"Go ahead, I'm not stopping you. Just don't hit the victim.\"",
		"\"Officer, why *do* we only have one gun?\" he asks -- carefully loading his pistolette.",
		"The lieutenant picks up his gun and then holsters it. \"In the name of god, please get a hang of yourself.\"",
		"\"The *Armistice* is sufficiently precise, officer. Especially at close range.\" He takes his sidearm from you and holsters it.",
		"\"By being a damn good shot -- Ace's High!\" The lieutenant raises his right hand, waiting for you to slap it.",
		"The High arrives with a sharp slap. As you turn around there is a moment of doubt -- feels like that Low ain't gonna *connect*...",
		"\"Looks like he worked for a private contractor -- like Evrart told us. Wealthy. With state ties. This is *way* above what we have.\"",
		"He holsters it. \"I *would* suggest we interview Evrart and Joyce -- the leader of the Union and the Wild Pines rep -- but we've already done that. So... it's up to you detective. Take us where we need to be.\"",
		"\"With shooting like that -- of course you are. Your station would not have assigned you to this case otherwise.\"",
		"\"He's a dangerous and corrupt man, and we cannot predict what he will want from us in return.\"",
		"\"The hangover is clearly making this worse for you. You could use some ammonia -- to clear your head.\"",
		"\"Hmm, correct.\" The lieutenant examines the wall closely. \"The density of the bullet holes is unusual, even in a general *average bullet hole frequency in Martinaise* sense. Grim affairs.\"",
		"The lieutenant gives a terse nod. \"Nothing for us to do here. Let's move along.\"",
		"The lieutenant matches your nodding pace. He's a true professional at this.",
		"\"Meaning, this is *a lot* of bullet holes.\" He brushes the wall with his hand. \"Looks like fully-automatic rifle fire. Something you don't see these days...\"",
		"\"Another likely scenario.\" The lieutenant nods.",
		"\"Perhaps the ones executed here were the loyalist-conservatives -- killed by the communists at the start of the civil war. Or it could have been the communists, put to death during the last stretch of the conflict by the Coalition forces.\"",
		"The lieutenant is nodding so hard it looks like his head is about to snap off his neck.",
		"\"Alright,\" the lieutenant coughs abruptly. \"It's a good moment to stop. My neck was starting to hurt. If there's nothing more, we should get going.\"",
		"He nods in agreement -- it really is a very serious scene, worth shaking your head over.",
		"\"Yeah... it's very unlikely the Coalition forces were the ones who died here. They were always the *last* ones against the wall.\"",
		"\"The manufacturing and sale of automatic rifles was curtailed after the Revolution. The destructive power of such tools proved to be... too much. We do need to retain some humanity in this world.\"",
		"A small bead of sweat runs down the side of the lieutenant's face as he maintains his nodding...",
		"\"Busted the neck, did you?\" He cranes his neck left and right, stretching. \"Glad I stopped when I did... my neck was really starting to hurt. Don't worry, it'll mend... now, we should get going.\"",
		"\"It could even have been the employees of the Feld R&D Center down the coast, as their building was taken over by the revolutionaries.\"",
		"\"To be honest, if a Coalition member was anyone in this situation -- it was the commandant. The superior giving the orders.\"",
		"At first the lieutenant doesn't say a word... he just stares at the wall. \"I don't know,\" he says finally. \"I don't know who died here, lined up beside that horrible wall. It could have been any of the parties involved in the Revolution.\"",
		"\"Alright,\" the lieutenant coughs abruptly. \"I'm glad we stopped when we did... my neck was starting to hurt. If there's nothing more, we should get going.\"",
		"The lieutenant also nods. It is quite a scene -- the two of you standing next to the broken wall of an abandoned building... nodding. Nodding along.",
		"As the lieutenant takes out a handkerchief and softly taps the sweat off his temple... a faint crack echoes through the coast...",
		"\"Why else?\" He's suddenly very attentive.",
		"\"Yes. Looking into your bedroom, miss.\" The lieutenant points to her window. The unmade bed is visible through the glass.",
		"\"...At any rate, the suspect isn't there anymore.\"",
		"The lieutenant gives you a little look.",
		"\"How long have you been staying here?\"",
		"\"Unfortunately, no, but if I were to guess -- long enough. The perforation is under the book shelf on your wall. It should not be hard to cover with some tape.\"",
		"\"Miss, we are investigating the murder of the man who was hanged.\" He looks down at the yard. \"The people responsible have asked us to talk to you.\"",
		"\"I am sure it has. In the time we've spent together, I must have covered 30 kilometres. He has a *track and field* approach to police work.\"",
		"\"Why is that?\"",
		"\"Let's see. I wrote down the nickname 'Lelystad'.\" The lieutenant has taken out his notebook. He moves his finger across the page…",
		"\"Miss, we are investigating the murder of the man down there.\" He looks down at the yard. \"The people who put him there have asked us to talk to you.\"",
		"\"And what's so bad about that?\"",
		"\"It's possible.\"",
		"\"Did you take the documents?\"",
		"\"This does not amount to actual corruption. I can easily log it under a confiscation.\"",
		"\"She's in dire straits. Could she have hidden in a place to which she has some kind of emotional attachment?\"",
		"\"What's so bad about that?\"",
		"The lieutenant makes a note in his notebook.",
		"\"My colleague has an *exploratory* sense of humour. Don't hold it against him.\"",
		"\"Miss, I don't know what he's told you, but there are no superstars among police officers.\"",
		"\"Yes, miss. I hope you don't mind.\" The lieutenant hands you his notes.",
		"\"I'm Kim Kitsuragi.\" The lieutenant steps in. \"I'm a detective from Precinct 57. I believe you have already met my colleague from Precinct 41.\"",
		"\"I'm Kim Kitsuragi.\" The lieutenant steps in. \"I'm a detective from Precinct 57. I see you've already met my colleague.\"",
		"\"I assure you, he is not about to tear it up in *any* style. In fact...\"",
		"\"We found that *crash pad* on the coast, miss, and even spoke to the land lady. She seemed... rather devoted to the suspect...\"",
		"\"Thank you, miss.\" He turns to you. \"We should do a thorough search of the fishing village.\"",
		"\"That is not actually what a police siren sounds like.\" The lieutenant turns to the young woman.",
		"The lieutenant looks away, over the railing.",
		"\"Yes, I understood that, officer.\" He turns to the young woman.",
		"\"I can assure you -- there really, really are *not*.\"",
		"\"Thank you for your candour -- why?\"",
		"\"Is that something that happens to you often, miss?\" His tone isn't aggressive, just inquisitive.",
		"\"It would, wouldn't it? It would be *strange*. You see...\"",
		"\"I don't think I've ever heard anything less relevant to any investigation.\"",
		"You hear the scribbling of the lieutenant's pen.",
		"...then tears one out and hands it to you. \"We have questions that might help solve some gaps in our field autopsy. I'm sure my colleague has a few of his own while I take notes.\"",
		"The lieutenant stops writing for a moment. He looks at you, then at the old woman.",
		"\"That's for the police to find out.\" The lieutenant takes out his familiar blue notebook. \"Right then, please answer each question to the best of your ability. I'm sure we have a few.\"",
		"\"You're still not saying it right.\"",
		"\"Hm...\" The lieutenant furrows his brow. He looks back to the children and sighs.",
		"\"I'm ready when you are.\" He turns his face away, toward nothing in particular.",
		"\"That's an *excellent* question, ma'am.\"",
		"\"I could use a breather, it's been another *track and field day*,\" the lieutenant says, rubbing his thigh.",
		"\"Yes. That is a downside of having a 130 kilowatt engine.\" His voice is tinged with pride. \"It lets the bad guys know when you're coming.\"",
		"\"Let's just get it out of the way as fast as we can. Contact dispatch from my Kineema and ask them to connect you to the station. Maybe they can shed some light on this.\"",
		"\"So they don't hold services there anymore? The Ecclesiastes?\"",
		"\"There was a murder in Martinaise.\" He points east. \"She might be a suspect. We would appreciate your help.\"",
		"\"A bullet?\" The lieutenant turns to you and gives you a little nod, then turns to the washerwoman:",
		"\"I wouldn't worry about that, ma'am. We're persistent.\"",
		"\"You didn't put it there, did you? *She* did.\"",
		"\"I had a few more questions about Ruby...\"",
		"\"Well, if you're not in the hostel in the morning, I'll know where to find you.\" He looks around and adds: \"Here. In a shack.\"",
		"\"I see, ma'am.\" The lieutenant turns to you. \"I hope you don't mind if we look around anyway.\"",
		"\"Did she talk to you much during her last stay?\"",
		"\"I'm ready when you are.\" He turns to the old woman. \"Thank you, ma'am.\"",
		"\"What did you say.\" The lieutenant gives you a puzzled look.",
		"\"What?\"",
		"You catch the lieutenant's side-glance, but he doesn't say anything.",
		"\"Let's just get it out of the way as fast as we can. Contact dispatch from my Kineema and ask them to connect you to the station. Maybe they can shed some light on this.\"",
		"\"We're not here to cause any trouble, madam.\"",
		"\"It's too late now.\"",
		"The lieutenant gives you a look and sighs. \"Let's go mail it.\"",
		"\"I could use a breather before another *runny* day begins...\"",
		"\"Riddles,\" the lieutenant marks dryly and looks around. \"Fits with the general *ambience* here.\"",
		"\"In fact, he does.\" The lieutenant glances at his watch.",
		"\"Nevermind,\" he says, shaking his head. \"Let's just continue.\"",
		"\"You're not. No one around here considers us an *ill omen*. People would have told us.\"",
		"\"We really should focus on some actual leads...\" The lieutenant looks around uncomfortably. \"Negotiating real estate deals isn't our main thing.\"",
		"\"Thank you, it's an honour,\" he says with a straight face, then turns to you. \"We should probably return to our *main* investigation here. This has been refreshing, but...\"",
		"\"That seems like a lot. Do we really have time for this... extracurricular venture?\"",
		"The lieutenant takes a short note in his notebook, then gestures for you to proceed.",
		"The lieutenant sighs at your flagrant misogyny.",
		"\"And we're not really the wildlife protection services.\"",
		"\"You *can*?\" The lieutenant makes a show of suppressing a sigh. \"Fine. It's better than having these people get pneumonia on the coast, but after *this*...\"",
		"The man surveys the cold coast. \"I have a feeling the only people foolish enough to spend their time skulking among the reeds are these poor fools... and us. But fine. It's not like we're drowning in leads.\"",
		"The lieutenant wrinkles his nose. \"I hope you're not buying this. He dispenses it without letting you touch the canister, so it would be precious, like holy water...\"",
		"\"Right. Which means you two can pack up and go back to the Whirling.\"",
		"\"You're right, dear.\" His face relaxes. \"It's a fair point. But what other explanation could there be?\" He turns to you.",
		"\"We're getting *really* carried away with this, aren't we?\" He makes a show of suppressing a sigh. \"Fine, it's better than having these people get pneumonia on the coast. But after this...\"",
		"\"Why not?\" The lieutenant shrugs. \"At least it will give us the excuse to look into a *lot* of reeds.\"",
		"\"Even relative to examining a week-old corpse, I'm not sure mucking about in the reeds qualifies as *fun*... but have it your way, detective...\"",
		"\"Khm...\" The lieutenant interjects. \"Just out of curiosity -- if there's no proof of its existence, how do you know it's real?\"",
		"\"My partner was joking,\" he says, unsure of himself. \"We're on a search of our own. It wouldn't hurt to check the reeds while we're at it... I assume that's what we'll be doing?\"",
		"\"Sir, your wife is waiting for you.\"",
		"\"Is it?\" he doesn't look too convinced but the small shrug indicates -- why not?",
		"\"Of course,\" the detective whispers to himself. \"More clever...\"",
		"\"Delinquents -- my favourite.\" It doesn't sound like it's really his favourite.",
		"\"This place is *much* better for field work in the summer, believe me.\"",
		"\"Tryin'a score some *dope*, man. Tryin'a score some smack -- you got any?\" He hops from one foot to the other.",
		"\"*Diamorphine*, girl. Quit clownin'. We need a hook-up for that D...\" He breathes in through his teeth.",
		"\"Yeah, man...\" The lieutenant suddenly appears to your right with his collar popped *insanely* high.",
		"\"Just no?\"",
		"\"... and neither have you. Had you let me in on the script of this play before you performed it, I could have gone along. As it stands, the entire line of questioning has been compromised.\"",
		"\"You.\" The lieutenant turns to you. \"If you were intending to use an unorthodox questioning technique for this branch of the investigation -- which, by the way, is tangential at best -- you should have let me in on it.\"",
		"\"Who doesn't just *love* drugs? All the drugs.\" The lieutenant's voice is flat, although with a seeming undertone of sarcasm.",
		"He rolls his collar down to normal human level and pulls out his familiar notebook. \"We're from the police, by the way.\"",
		"The lieutenant is watching the scene unfold before his eyes, unsure how to react.",
		"The lieutenant is watching the scene unfold before his eyes, unsure how to react.",
		"\"Aren't there any local authorities who might look down on such activities?\"",
		"\"We have nothing left to do but hope this *was* a play on your part -- and to move on. Now.\" He turns to the young woman. \"We have some questions for you.\"",
		"\"The *D*, man, gotta hit that D!\"",
		"\"Really? What's that?\"",
		"\"This... isn't really about the hat, is it?\"",
		"\"'Left it all behind.' Are you sure you did?\" The lieutenant narrows his eyes at the girl. \"Who can tell with all the delinquent behaviour?\"",
		"\"This is not a good questioning technique.\"",
		"\"Thing is, I haven't said *party*...\"",
		"\"Three-point-six billion, not counting those on Seol.\"",
		"\"Okay.\" The lieutenant stops hopping. \"That's... that's real bad. Someone should definitely look into that...\"",
		"\"As it stands, I'm going to have to thwart your plan by explaining to the woman that we are police officers.\"",
		"\"No, I don't think it would lead anywhere with Evrart. He's just going to deny it.\"",
		"\"No, it doesn't.\"",
		"\"Got any dope? We need some dope bad.\" He scratches his nose, then his armpit through the jacket. \"I got the *Boogie Street* shakes.\"",
		"\"Yes, what *do* you mean?\" The lieutenant sounds serious.",
		"\"Tryin'a score some *dope*, man. Like we planned. Tryin'a score some smack -- you got any?\" He hops from one foot to the other in anticipation.",
		"\"A what?\"",
		"\"In the future, could you please refrain from emoting too much on duty? The quasi-legal status of the RCM means we need to project strength twice as consistently as any other police force in the world.\"",
		"\"So, what do *you* think happened?\"",
		"\"Thank you.\"",
		"\"Uh huh.\"",
		"\"Yes. A clever ruse. I see.\"",
		"The lieutenant blinks. \"So you're saying you *didn't* break down in tears just now and nearly tear your shirt off?\"",
		"\"Do you, uh, want to *talk* about what just happened?\"",
		"\"Then let's go.\"",
		"\"Who indeed?\"",
		"The lieutenant merely nods.",
		"\"That's us. Revachol Citizens Militia. The police.\"",
		"\"Normally I'm opposed to discussing one's feelings, especially on-duty, but I think this is an exceptional case...\"",
		"\"Glad to hear it was 'minor.' Can you go on?\"",
		"\"Not when projecting strength -- then it's just weakness.\"",
		"\"Yes, I've definitely never seen you cry before, nor lent you my handkerchief to dry your tears.\"",
		"\"Good. Controlling your emotions sounds good.\"",
		"\"That may be so, but such is Revachol and this is what is expected of us -- in Revachol.\"",
		"\"Okay, right. Enough of this.\"",
		"\"... and, come to think of it, Frittte's probably closed at this hour. They're open from seven to eleven.\"",
		"\"This is a thoughtful exchange, but can we move on please?\"",
		"\"Okay...\" He turns to you with a heavy sigh. \"I *might* have something in my motor carriage we can use. When you're done here.\"",
		"Make that three. The lieutenant is nodding too, hands crossed.",
		"The lieutenant nods in agreeance.",
		"\"It's not something I'd wear on the job.\" He smiles slightly.",
		"\"Good question.\" He turns to the cafeteria manager.",
		"\"I'll take a room here too.\" He opens his wallet.",
		"He turns to the man. \"Thank you anyway.\"",
		"\"Good pick,\" the lieutenant nods.",
		"\"I hate to say it, but looks like we're going to have to ask Cuno if he knows of a spare fridge around here.\"",
		"\"We should really take another look at that fridge we found in the basement.\"",
		"\"I assure you, it was him.\"",
		"\"Frittte. Near the gates.\" The lieutenant sounds tired. \"They'll exchange it.\"",
		"\"We should return to this theory at a later time, officer. This here was about the *trash container*.\"",
		"\"I am sure,\" he says, smiling at the plastic-wrapped shoes in their neon glory.",
		"\"Thank you for clearing that up. Why do you keep the container locked?\"",
		"\"Don't thank me yet. You still owe me 60 reál for three nights stay. If you don't have it by tonight, I can't let you up there...\" He points upstairs, toward your room.",
		"\"It concerns the case.\" The lieutenant's voice is harsh and sudden. \"Please cooperate.\"",
		"\"You can cash it in at the local Frittte, near the harbour gates -- though it might not be enough to cover it...\"",
		"\"We should find out who this loud faction is, occupying the booth. Loudness means talkative -- and we need info.\" The lieutenant gives you a meaningful nod.",
		"\"Some do take recompense.\" The lieutenant is dead serious. \"But only to survive.\"",
		"\"Exactly --\" He looks at you. \"But all in due time. Crypto-business is not a priority right now.\"",
		"\"What are we talking about? Was this not about the trash container?\"",
		"\"I feel good about our work here today.\" The lieutenant nods. \"It's all about the little things -- like bringing people random stuffed animals.\"",
		"\"Sir, he was only asking a question. It's his job -- and mine. See that it's covered.\"",
		"\"...I feel I must remind you that we are here to conduct an important investigation that also affects *your* business.\"",
		"He sighs. \"Let's go talk to the Frittte clerk.\"",
		"\"Wonderful.\"",
		"\"No one was implying you were, officer. Where were we?\"",
		"\"We don't. We have to wait. They'll show up sooner or later.\" He looks toward the booth. \"Men get hungry. Even striking men. If not today, then they'll be here tomorrow.\"",
		"There's a shuffle of nylon as Lieutenant Kitsuragi looks for something in the pockets of his orange bomber.",
		"\"It was you?\"",
		"The lieutenant is painfully silent.",
		"\"In your defence -- neither do I.\"",
		"\"They actually did it...\" The lieutenant stares in amazement at the package.",
		"\"It would only be for a...\"",
		"\"We should return to the case of your *mistaken identity* at a later time, officer. This was about the *trash container*.\"",
		"\"Relax, Mr. Garte. I'm sure there is no *Doom*. He simply wants to share his discoveries with you.\"",
		"\"Hmh.\" The lieutenant thinks. \"I have a feeling we'll make their acquaintance sooner or later.\"",
		"\"We don't. We have to wait. They'll show up sooner or later.\" He looks toward the booth. \"Men get hungry. Even men on strike.\"",
		"\"Thank you, sir. And he appreciated the clean room, by the way. He just likes to act like he doesn't.\"",
		"\"He's right,\" the lieutenant whispers, \"you *really* have to sort out your money problems, starting tomorrow. I can't help you again.\"",
		"\"We should find out who this loud faction is, occupying the booth. Loudness means talkative -- and we need info.\" He gives you a meaningful nod.",
		"\"Seems we're just going to have to keep looking around.\"",
		"\"Fair enough. Now if we're finished discussing this, can we return to solving the murder?\" He struggles to keep his smile.",
		"\"I thought as much -- and are you the only party with access to the trash container?\"",
		"A thought flickers in his eyes, and is then extinguished. He shakes his head. \"Keep them, detective. You earned it.\"",
		"\"Ah, the illusive CS Municipal. I doubt we'll be able to track down who was sent here last and when. This will have to be one of those *little* threads that solves itself -- down the road.\"",
		"\"Seems we have no choice but to trust in Cuno now.\"",
		"\"I understand your predicament as the manager. However...\" He adjusts his glasses.",
		"\"I'll take a room here too.\" He opens his wallet.",
		"He simply nods.",
		"\"You might,\" he nods. \"It's important not to let one's *style* interfere with their work.\"",
		"\"Excuse me. I was lecturing you. I shouldn't have. You should consult a medical professional if you feel that you need help. You can use the radio in my Kineema to call your station's *lazareth*.\"",
		"He corrects his glasses. \"I say this from a purely tactical standpoint of course.\"",
		"\"But isn't that *our* job?\"",
		"\"If I were trying to get in touch with the Coalition, I would start by seeking him out. But first you might need to speak with his *young companion*.\"",
		"\"If you're trying to get in touch with the Coalition, I would start by finding some way to apologise to him. But first you might need to speak with his *young companion*.\"",
		"He thinks for a second. \"Okay, maybe I do.\"",
		"\"A good joke.\"",
		"\"Then why did they send you?\"",
		"\"It's always good to have a police officer who can see and feel.\"",
		"\"Sorry, I'm really no expert on this sort of thing...\"",
		"\"I'd appreciate it if you didn't force us into situations where I may have to shoot random civilians. Because that won't get us anywhere.\"",
		"\"Excuse me. I was lecturing you. I shouldn't have. You should consult a medical professional if you feel that you need help.\"",
		"\"Is that enough of a secret for you?\"",
		"After decades unchallenged, the lieutenant is caught off-guard by your brazen provocation, but his counter comes fast and hard. This could get ugly...",
		"\"No, there are couple of people who haven't smoked cannabis. I'm sure of that.\"",
		"\"Except that I *do*, detective.\"",
		"\"This psycho-drama is unbecoming of an officer.\"",
		"\"Not a fan. It's just the nature of lieutenancy.\"",
		"\"I think the dispatch desk just told both our stations about the hanging. There was quite the brouhaha at the 57th, I can tell you that. 'Time to *settle it*', they said, '*Cop Off*'. But...\" He leans in: \"I assure you, I am not their *finest* or *toughest*, with *one hundred-and-two cases solved*. What I am is *least interested in a pissing competition*.\"",
		"\"That's commendable. Was there anything else?\"",
		"He looks at his pants. \"Where is this going?\"",
		"\"Okay.\"",
		"He turns his attention elsewhere.",
		"\"... but *am* I? I'll spare you another twenty hours thinking about it -- yes, I am. Now let's get back to work.\"",
		"\"If you ask me, it's high time for you to set aside these frivolous *side tasks* and focus 100% of your energies on the case before us.\"",
		"\"They didn't identify themselves in any way. The tone was muffled using a device of some sort. The desk could identify neither the caller's age nor sex.\"",
		"\"If you could only find your gun.\"",
		"\"Detective, about what the twins had to say...\"",
		"\"... Alright then.\"",
		"\"What is this place?\" The lieutenant stares at the dusty training equipment.",
		"\"I think we may have this...\" The lieutenant whispers, then gives the suspect a short glance.",
		"\"Okay. What do you think is going on with that computer, chalkboard, and fireplace?\"",
		"\"Hmmm, that's a fair point. Alright, for the good of the investigation, what do you want to know?\"",
		"The lieutenant produces his small blue notebook and idly thumbs through a few pages.",
		"\"For real detective work, nothing beats a good notebook by your side...\"",
		"\"It will turn into quite the puzzle yet, I'm afraid...\" The lieutenant nods.",
		"\"Something the matter, detective?\"",
		"\"Yes?\"",
		"\"I do not have a *thing* with revolutionary air brigades in particular.\"",
		"\"Ah, yes. The case brief you missed. Now I remember.\" He opens his notes.",
		"\"Wonderful.\" He does not seem surprised. \"What is your takeaway?\"",
		"\"You mean like a brief? Do you want me to brief you again?\"",
		"\"It would be immensely ugly of them, not to mention unprofessional.... But I also think it's somewhat unlikely.\"",
		"The lieutenant's quizzical expression gradually deepens into a frown.",
		"\"Simple, because Moralintern types *love* to form committees.\"",
		"\"You know who might be, though? That Mr. Villedrouin, the uh... gentleman you needlessly antagonised in the apartments...\"",
		"\"You know who might be, though? That Mr. Villedrouin, the uh... gentleman you met in the young man's apartment...\"",
		"\"They -- Klaasje, as we've come to suspect -- didn't identify themselves in any way. The tone was muffled using a device of some sort. The desk could identify neither the caller's age nor sex.\"",
		"\"I don't need a patrol cap.\"",
		"\"It can't be that...\" Part of him sort of wants to believe what you just said.",
		"\"Wouldn't that be something? And who could say it's not true? If you really don't remember anything... how would you know?\" The thought makes him uneasy. \"We should move.\"",
		"\"Sort of like how hanging around the liquor store hasn't made you into a master distiller.\"",
		"\"Looks like we have more to discuss with those so-called *Hardie boys*.\" His voice is lowered. \"Half their reasoning just went out the window.\"",
		"\"You can always use the radio in my Kineema to call your station's lazareth again. Was there anything else you wanted?\"",
		"\"Anyhow, let's get back to the case. Was there anything else you wanted to know?\"",
		"\"I have, on a few occasions -- when I was young and foolish -- smoked hemp.\"",
		"\"...\"",
		"\"Then you're in luck, because we're in the midst of a *major* strike by the Dockworkers' Union. Maybe more than that. The Union clearly wants a *piece*, not just of the Industrial Harbour, but the Wild Pines corporation itself...\"",
		"\"I do not harbour a sentiment for revolutionary air brigades in particular.\"",
		"\"I've noticed -- and okay. The Revolution employed a more forward-looking eight-rotor design. Their blades were foldable and their pilots were better trained and motivated.\"",
		"\"Okay -- was there anything else?\"",
		"\"If you ask me, it's past time for you to cut back on the smoking. You seem like a man with a death wish. It's quite disturbing.\"",
		"\"It's a good thing you found that gun. I can see why they sent you now.\"",
		"No response. He just arches his brow.",
		"\"I find that highly unlikely. It's not unusual for detectives to feel complicit in the crime until the perpetrator is apprehended. Especially when the investigation is dragging. So let's get back to it, shall we?\"",
		"\"You did well,\" the lieutenant says as soon as you've left the apartment. The balcony feels cool and quiet, with a stunning view over the district.",
		"\"*Me*?\"",
		"\"So, what? That makes *you* the *new school*? Gods spare us...\"",
		"\"It's not a big deal. I don't do it any more.\" An almost imperceptible sigh. \"But it happened a few times. In my twenties.\"",
		"\"It's dark,\" the lieutenant states the obvious.",
		"\"Excuse me?\"",
		"\"I'm sure you don't. It's just a stupid inter-departmental thing. I'm making assumptions... we should move on.\"",
		"\"Now -- was there anything else or should we get to it?\"",
		"\"If you ask me, it's high time for you to put the bottle away. Sober up, get back to basics. That would be my advice.\"",
		"\"Yes. I'm an unrepentant spoilsport.\" The lieutenant appears pleased with this.",
		"\"Do you *need* something, detective?\"",
		"\"Officer, what was that?\"",
		"\"You wouldn't have been sent to investigate this case if you had close connections with the Union -- at least that's the hope. Also,\" he looks you over, \"you don't strike me as a *Union man*.\"",
		"\"Besides, I doubt you could have taken down a hardened mercenary single-handedly...\"",
		"\"I'm relieved that you agree,\" he says, then pauses.",
		"\"I don't see how *my* life is pertinent to the investigation.\"",
		"The lieutenant immediately grasps the stakes. His gears turn as he prepares a devastating counter. This could get ugly...",
		"\"No, something isn't happening. Because it's not part of...\" He makes a precise hand gesture: \"Reality.\"",
		"\"Good. Yes. Because it's not part of Reality.\"",
		"\"I don't think I can say one way or another. I do think it's somewhat unlikely, though.\"",
		"\"Fascinating. And here I believed your recent turn toward moralism was just an act.\"",
		"The silence carries.",
		"\"Okay.\" He takes a step back. \"Style me.\"",
		"He's waiting.",
		"\"It's good to have....\" His mouth twitches as he comes up with the expression: \"...an *ambidextrous para-detective* in a labour dispute. I can see why they sent you -- should we go?\"",
		"\"Are you thinking of... you know?\" He gestures toward his cheeks with an invisible razor.",
		"\"My apologies, detective. I couldn't resist.\"",
		"He sighs. \"If you insist. What do you want to know?\"",
		"The lieutenant relaxes his eyebrow, and you seem to regain control of yourself.",
		"An almost imperceptible snap inside the lieutenant. His shoulders relax, his eyebrow casually descending as he tries his best to look relaxed, nonchalant even.",
		"\"I can assure nothing like that will happen. Do you know why not?\"",
		"\"That's because I'm half-Seolite. Or quarter. My father's father was from Seol -- so was my grandmother, but from my mother's side...\" He shakes his head. \"It's not an interesting topic.\"",
		"\"What?\"",
		"\"Later.\" His voice is unflinching. \"Was there anything else you wanted to know about the case?\"",
		"The lieutenant is thinking to himself. His eyebrows are slightly raised.",
		"\"I'm good enough for this case. I'm not here to compete. I came because I had to. My fellow officers -- the sergeants, in particular -- would have made this scene into a circus.\"",
		"\"Really?\" His eyebrow gets raised one more notch.",
		"\"It's not that many. Officer, I'm sure you have a lot more cases solved. Now...\"",
		"\"When you said before that you were *down with racism* -- was it meant in earnest or were you just trying to win his confidence?\"",
		"\"I guess you *don't* need glasses, then.\"",
		"The lieutenant's face turns a ruddy shade. \"I can *assure* you, detective, that I've passed *all* the required physical exams within the last year. Can you say the same?\"",
		"\"I don't know. Containers... contain, I guess. I'm making assumptions. We should move on.\"",
		"\"What do you want to know?\"",
		"\"Three days ago, the RCM Emergencies Desk received a report about a security guard who was found hanged in Martinaise. An anonymous caller said there was a dead body behind the Whirling-in-Rags hostel-cafeteria. The cadaver had been there for four days -- no one had come to investigate...\"",
		"\"During that time, the victim had been stripped of his belongings. The caller did not identify him, but used the word *lynching*. There is an ongoing labour dispute between the local dockworkers and the logistics company Wild Pines. I was told we should approach the death as part of this dispute.\"",
		"\"Strike, coup, revolution, it's brigandage however you parse it.\"",
		"\"Have you tried concentrating on something other than your personal affairs?\"",
		"\"Then you should consider seeking medical attention. You can use the radio in my Kineema to call your station's *lazareth*. Was there anything else you wanted?\"",
		"\"You don't know?\" His eyes narrow. \"I assumed you were in on it.\"",
		"\"I hope you do.\"",
		"\"No, not *really*. Was there anything else?\"",
		"\"I checked the records. This jurisdiction dispute -- who polices Martinaise -- reaches back to the Thirties. It's as old as my station. And all this time we can't decide who gets Martinaise? I think, yes, both stations would prefer a win.\"",
		"\"Ah, I'm glad to hear it, detective. I was wondering when we'd get to this very subject.\"",
		"\"In the New, twenty years ago. It's what a modern cop looked like then.\"",
		"\"Yes.\"",
		"\"So the 41st Precinct sent you, because you are the most mentally ill out of all the officers at your station?\"",
		"\"Either way, good on you.\" The lieutenant gathers himself. \"You were saying...?\"",
		"\"That's correct.\"",
		"\"Yes, cannabis. The hemp. I rolled it into a small paper tube and lit in on fire. Then I *inhaled* the fumes. I was young.\"",
		"The lieutenant anticipates your move but can neither deflect nor parry your counter-counter assault. A single drop of sweat trickles down his cheek...",
		"\"I hope you don't take this the wrong way, it's just a collegial observation. In the 57th we call it the 'Jamrock shuffle'. Officers from Jamrock's 41st Precinct tend to move a bit erratically.\"",
		"\"It's just stupidity. We shouldn't waste any more time on it. If you want my take, ask me after we've inspected the victim.\"",
		"\"Good.\" The lieutenant nods.",
		"\"There was some interest in this case at my station, but not for the reasons you have in mind. You seem to wish there was...\"",
		"\"Okay -- let's *talk* about it. You stole the boots.\" He looks at the gleaming technological footwear you're sporting.",
		"\"I'm glad to hear that. I'm glad to see you're stable.\" He nods approvingly. \"Keep it that way. Now -- was there anything else, or should we get to it?\"",
		"\"Of course.\" Sounds like you just answered his question.",
		"\"Safe? No. But you're old. You've made it this far. *Something* has brought you through. We've only just started working together, so I don't know what it is yet. But it's there.\"",
		"\"Why are you pronouncing it like you're a Coalition bureaucrat?\"",
		"\"You know what? Forget it. What *specifically* are you trying to assign responsibility *for*?\"",
		"\"Martinaise? Nothing. It's just a puddle at the end of some drainpipe. No one cares about this place, they care about sports. Most of our colleagues don't even know how to get here. North of the Interchange doesn't exist.\"",
		"\"No I don't. I *used* to. Plain clothes did the trick. For both of us, it seems.\" He nods toward you. \"Now...\"",
		"\"I agree. Too dark.\"",
		"\"This is not going quite as I hoped it would, detective.\" The lieutenant's voice is hushed.",
		"\"We should think about calling it a day, maybe? The nights are still miserably cold this time of year.\"",
		"\"What about me?\"",
		"\"What, *think*? I do most of my work inside my notebook...\"",
		"\"Besides, those days are long behind me.\"",
		"\"Yes.\" He nods. \"Let's hurry now, I'm living on borrowed time.\"",
		"\"Do you want me to brief you?\"",
		"\"Let's not.\"",
		"\"You're barking up the wrong tree. I don't speak a word of Seolite, I've never met either one of my grandparents. And I've never *been* to Seol.\" He seems almost proud of these things. \"I'm a regular Revacholiere.\"",
		"\"Yes, it's a wholly pointless matter. Forget I ever mentioned it.\"",
		"\"To be completely honest, detective, I've been meaning to raise that very subject with you.\"",
		"\"So what *are* we talking about, then?\"",
		"\"Mental illness.\"",
		"\"I bet you do.\"",
		"The lieutenant considers your muttonchops for a long moment. A slight grimace crosses his face.",
		"He sighs. \"Well, we've yet to find any real evidence pointing to you in this case, or even a possible motive, so let's not add you to the list of suspects just yet.\"",
		"\"I've been meaning to have a little chat with you about your sense of *style*.\"",
		"\"Politics is habit-forming. And hazardous. It is also irrelevant to policework. You are right to doubt the impulse, it might be detrimental to our task here.\"",
		"\"I can't say that it does, no. When I need to think, I just use my notebook...\"",
		"Your brain sends the signal to your lips but they refuse the order. Something is paralysing them. You're pretty sure it has something to do with the lieutenant's eyebrow.",
		"The lieutenant relaxes his eyebrow, and you seem to regain control of yourself.",
		"\"It was a joke, sadly. There's nothing I can do about your delinquency.\" He sighs. \"What's done is done. Let's get back to policework.\"",
		"\"In Elysium,\" he replies. \"Behind our eyes. Like all human beings, detective.\" He looks around and sighs. \"The world is what it is. I'm glad to see you're stable. Keep it that way.\"",
		"\"It *all* seems unreal, detective. In actuality, the pale is no more unreal than, say, water. Or death. Or that we're stuck behind our eyes, between our own ears, talking...\" He looks around, pensive suddenly.",
		"\"You didn't stop at all, did you? You're just obsessing about *other people's* sexuality now.\"",
		"\"Yes, uhm...\" The lieutenant stares at your shaven face, his eyes narrowed. \"Uhhhh...\" he mumbles. \"I don't know what to say.\" He coughs. \"Perhaps...\"",
		"\"That's us. The Revachol Citizens Militia. We're the police in this city.\"",
		"\"No.\"",
		"\"Which school do you subscribe to -- Mambo...\" He opens the other hand: \"...or Jambo?\"",
		"He opens one hand and looks at it. A moment passes.",
		"\"There is no gift. We should move.\"",
		"\"That's a good point. It could happen any day now.\"",
		"\"This might be just the place to help you rectify your... financial situation.\"",
		"\"Extremely.\"",
		"\"Well, sort of. It's less a matter of who *gets* to police Martinaise than who *has* to. It's an orphan district, in other words...\"",
		"After decades unchallenged, the lieutenant's reaction is a bit slow, but he's not letting you have this. Not for a second. This could get ugly...",
		"\"They say it's a scene-clearing technique developed by one of your lieutenants for gathering evidence. It's erratic, yet thorough. Prioritises containers.\"",
		"\"Some *you* time?\" The lieutenant considers this a moment. \"This is a police investigation, not a journey of self-discovery. You'll still have your evenings to yourself.\"",
		"\"Better still than an imbecilic *Cop Off*.\"",
		"\"The *cop* kind. Our Precincts can't decide if Martinaise is part of Jamrock or the Industrial Harbour. *Yours* or *mine*, as if we somehow *own* parts of the city. Typical street-gang mentality.... so we've let the Union make a mockery of law enforcement here. And now it's come to its natural conclusion.\"",
		"\"Okay, I admit to it. The Revolution employed a more forward-looking eight-rotor design. Their blades were foldable and their pilots were better trained and motivated.\"",
		"\"Mhm. I don't speak a word of Seolite and I've never met either one of my grandparents. There is nothing *ethnic* I can tell you. Or anyone else.\"",
		"\"It's a part of the world, officer. A geopolitical entity -- *and* a geographic division. I told you it wouldn't be interesting.\"",
		"\"Was there anything else you wanted to ask about the competition? If not, we should move.\"",
		"\"Oh? You will?\" He raises his collar. His eyes narrow. \"Then I will *help* you to do so. Now...\"",
		"\"It's good we set this thing aside.\"",
		"\"You're right, detective. My apologies.\"",
		"\"Alright, we're finished here. Let's quickly debrief and go over what we found -- so we don't do it in front of the company rep.\"",
		"\"Look, it's not unusual for detectives to feel complicit in the crime until the perpetrator is identified and apprehended. Especially when the investigation is dragging. So let's get back to it, shall we?\"",
		"\"Ah, right. Your *condition*. Nevermind. All I mean to say is that we have a puzzle on our hands, but not all the pieces... yet.\"",
		"\"All I ask is the chance to close this final case so I can go to the chaise with a clean conscience.\" His voice is filled with mock pathos. \"Let's hurry, I'm living on borrowed time.\"",
		"\"The deceased is a security guard for a corporation involved in a labour dispute. It doesn't take a Dolorian polymath to put the pieces together. I just don't see the case getting more *mysterious* than that.\"",
		"\"Yes, it just so happens there's a beautiful, blonde nineteen year old woman at the heart of this case. A rich one, in fact. Part of a murder-sex-cult.\"",
		"\"Anyway.\"",
		"\"If you're serious about this, you might keep your eyes out for any Coalition officials we might happen to run across.\"",
		"\"What happened to you?\" the lieutenant asks as he leans in, eyes mapping your frozen face.",
		"\"Okay. Well. We are police officers. It is our job to find the killer. So that's what I intend to do. You should try too.\"",
		"\"Of course. Here's my gun and my badge.\" His hands reach out empty. \"They'll put me in the chaise for this, but it feels good to have it off my chest.\"",
		"\"Agreed.\" Only a fraction of a smirk in the corner of his mouth betrays his amusement. \"Was there anything else?\"",
		"\"...\"",
		"\"Please do,\" he says. \"We wouldn't want your *regimen* to spill over into the investigation.\"",
		"\"There's a strong prejudice against involving the RCM in what's seen as *Union matters*. The Dockworkers' Union is the de facto police in Martinaise. Now -- it appears -- they've started executing too. We cannot allow that.\"",
		"\"Maybe you can tell me what you *do* know? To help me narrow it down a bit.\"",
		"\"Really?\" The lieutenant gives you a look, thorough as if performing triage. \"You look fine to me.\"",
		"\"Okay. I wanted to become an aerostatic pilot. Then I turned ten and realized we no longer have an air force.\"",
		"\"In any event, I am just a humble law official. I may work under the Moralintern's umbrella, but I'm certainly not qualified to serve on any 'committee'.\"",
		"\"Local law enforcement solving one little homicide decides nothing. Not solving it... can have real and calculable effects. Things can always get worse. Matter of fact, augury, we should move.\"",
		"\"It is good to have a para-detective in a labour dispute. I can see why they sent you -- should we go?\"",
		"\"The 41st is known to kill people. Often.\"",
		"\"Okay... About that call.\"",
		"\"Was there something else you wished to discuss?\"",
		"\"Just to be clear -- we are police officers. It's our job to find the killer. That's the case. Uncover and arrest the killer.\"",
		"\"Excellent. Was there anything else?\"",
		"\"That's good to hear. I have little patience for the *swinging dick* style of police work. It's patience and intelligence that solves cases... Was there anything else?\"",
		"\"Frankly, detective, you're in a deranged state. I can't let you proceed without *close* supervision. In fact, under normal circumstances I'd be duty-bound to report you. Take it as a token of good faith between our precincts that I haven't done so.\"",
		"\"That's good.\"",
		"The lieutenant adjusts his collar. It doesn't look like he *wants* the case to be more mysterious.",
		"\"There's no reason to *wing* anything. If you didn't get the brief, that's okay, I did.\"",
		"\"Try work. The case at hand. It can work miracles.\"",
		"\"Do you know the feeling when you've begun filling in a crossword but some of your answers don't quite seem to fit? That's the feeling I have right now, for some reason...\"",
		"\"What, this?\" he zips up the large collar. \"It's just seasonal clothing.\"",
		"\"Congratulations. That must have taken an enormous, concerted effort. *Considerable* ingenuity. And timing. Now -- I'm going to report you and you're going to go to jail.\"",
		"\"Am I?\" He arches his brow. \"Anyway, did you want something -- related to policework?\"",
		"\"Sure.\" He nods. \"Anyway, did you want something -- related to policework?\"",
		"\"I am the finest of nothing.\"",
		"\"... but am I? I'll spare you another *20 hour mind-project* -- yes, I am. Now let's get back to work.\"",
		"\"Actually it does have to be murder. This is a murder investigation. But we digress.\"",
		"\"But isn't that *your* job?\"",
		"\"Ah, now I understand...\" The lieutenant nods his head gravely.",
		"\"I wouldn't say that. And my case load is measly, but that's beside the point...\"",
		"\"Morning.\" He gives you a quick nod.",
		"The lieutenant appears unfazed. \"And what has led you to this conclusion?\"",
		"\"That is a common side effect of overindulgence. It will pass.\"",
		"\"Thus far your memory loss does not seem to be *convenient* for you or anyone else. Except insofar as you've managed to avoid doing any work.\"",
		"\"So, the death notification...\" the lieutenant says as soon as you've left the apartment.",
		"The lieutenant narrows a single eyebrow. \"No.\"",
		"\"Good.\" Only a fraction of a smirk in the corner of his mouth betrays his amusement. \"But enough of this. Was there anything else?\"",
		"\"Is that secret enough for you?\"",
		"A moment passes. The lieutenant glances at the sports watch on his wrist.",
		"\"That would be us. The Revachol Citizens Militia.\"",
		"\"When I said we have to navigate community matters, I did not mean we have any *say* in them. I meant we should be careful. If we are not... the *shit* will blow right in our faces.\" He makes a quick gesture towards his visage -- where the shit would blow.",
		"\"Okay, Art Cop.\"",
		"\"So no, I don't think they sent you as a joke. And even if they did, they are in for a surprise.\"",
		"\"Great. Imagine all the time you'll have for work now -- matter of fact, we should get back to it right now.\"",
		"\"And I hope we don't even need to discuss the *street drugs* you've been abusing...\"",
		"The lieutenant's posture becomes rigid and uncomfortable as you lean forward and sniff the area just above his shoulder blade...",
		"\"I do like to *hang around* the motor pool every now and then, but that doesn't make me a mechanic.\"",
		"\"I do like the way it tingles, though. It's the only part of shaving I actually look forward to.\"",
		"\"Hmm, perhaps you're a more proficient *cruciverbalist* than I am. All I mean to say is that we have a puzzle on our hands, but not all the pieces... yet.\"",
		"Reflexes take over, the lieutenant's brow meets yours: His fierce counter nearly tears your face off. This could get ugly...",
		"\"Detective, if I may be frank -- you seem to be in a deranged state. You have trouble remembering things, you've *misplaced* your badge. I cannot let you act in the name of the RCM without supervision until you've regained control of your faculties.\"",
		"\"Detective, if I may be frank -- you seem to be in a deranged state. You have trouble remembering things. I cannot let you act in the name of the RCM without supervision until you've regained control of your faculties.\"",
		"\"I expect the case itself to be less challenging than navigating these *community matters*. This district isn't used to the RCM's presence, and the Union rarely overplays its hand -- as it appears to have done in this case...\"",
		"\"I'm afraid you and I are pawns in a...\" He considers the phrasing. \"A *pissing* competition.\"",
		"\"Interesting. I think it's called a brain.\"",
		"\"I can't stop a grown man from learning about the fundamental geographic and entroponetic features of our world, can I?\"",
		"\"Excuse me. Large topics are not my forte. You seem stable enough. Keep it that way. Now -- was there anything else or should we get to it?\"",
		"\"Safe? No. But you're old. You've made it this far. Something has brought you through. I haven't worked with you yet, so I don't know what it is. But it's there.\"",
		"\"You mean like a brief? Do you want me to brief you?\"",
		"\"If you ask me, it's past time for you to lay off the *street drugs* you've been abusing. They really aren't helping us solve the case.\"",
		"\"Now, was there anything else?\"",
		"\"Well, *technically*,\" the lieutenant says, somewhat sheepishly. \"The official record keeper has been known to double-count murder-suicides.\"",
		"\"Hmm...\" He raises an eyebrow, thinking it best to let you make the next move.",
		"\"It's nothing fancy, just plain old Taiga Super Special...\"",
		"\"I'm not really sure about this turn of events. I... think the mutton chops might have been a better idea. They sort of seemed to cover up some of the...\" He stops.",
		"\"Any theories about what happened here?\" He gazes down at the sign.",
		"The lieutenant glances at his electronic wristwatch.",
		"\"Teenage nonsense,\" he dead pans. \"You would have had to be ready to use lethal force long ago, when you joined the RCM.\"",
		"\"Good point. Martinaise is *famed* for its occult sex-murder rites. We'll get on it *immediately*.\"",
		"\"Binoclard? Is that how they do things over at the 41st? No wonder your clearance rate is so low.\"",
		"\"Then you're not that far behind, actually. Do you want me to brief you?\"",
		"\"To find him or her is one of our tasks here. For now all we know is that the tone was muffled using a device of some sort -- the desk could identify neither the caller's age nor sex.\"",
		"\"Okay then. Was there anything else you wanted to know?\"",
		"\"Was there anything else you wanted to know about the case?\"",
		"\"Fine. We should get through the day first. Off-hours begin at 21:00. If you're still having trouble then, I can give you an orientation.\"",
		"\"I've considered it.\" His voice is sombre.",
		"\"Because it's not part of...\" He makes a precise hand gesture: \"Reality.\"",
		"\"A security guard or worker of some sort, hired by Wild Pines. This was just hearsay from Martinaise, of course. We need to find out the truth.\"",
		"\"Good.\" He glances impatiently at his electronic wristwatch.",
		"\"I can see you're disappointed.\" A brief smile. \"You're right to be -- I don't speak a word of Seolite. I've never met either one of my grandparents. I've never been to Seol. I'm a regular, garden variety Revacholiere.\"",
		"\"I for one hope I don't have to use my service weapon at all -- like a *normal* police officer.\"",
		"\"Are you sure? Who could say it's not true? If you really don't remember anything.... how would you know?\" The thought makes him uneasy. \"We should move.\"",
		"\"Oh no, it's very imaginable. We fail to place responsibility for the hanging, the harbour company see the situation is out of control so they bring in private military, maybe a gunship, the Union responds in strength. Automatic fire.\"",
		"\"Hangovers do give officers super-powers. Many drink only to receive *the gift*.\"",
		"\"I didn't know that was even possible. It must be a great burden.\"",
		"\"I didn't mean to offend. It's your business, of course.\"",
		"\"No-no, it's... okay, I guess.\" He keeps staring at you, dumbfounded. \"I may have preferred the mutton chops, they sort of seemed to... cover the...\" He stops.",
		"\"Khm...\" Having looked away during the final phase of your little episode, the lieutenant now addresses you.",
		"\"What in the name of hell was *that* supposed to be?!\" The lieutenant is gritting his teeth.",
		"\"Now, was there anything else you wanted to know about the case?\"",
		"\"Good. Let's change the subject.\"",
		"\"What do you mean?\"",
		"\"Yes?\" His eyebrows remain completely level.",
		"\"The hemp,\" he repeats. \"Cannabis. Is that secret enough for you?\"",
		"\"You have a...\" He's looking for the right words. \"...a *distinctive* way of walking. If I were to walk *in front* of you, we would surely collide.\"",
		"The lieutenant blinks, his mouth slightly open and his body motionless. A microsecond passes.",
		"\"That's good.\"",
		"\"What's there to say? It's just stupidity.\"",
		"\"Absolutely nothing.\"",
		"\"Then I was right to spare you from it, no?\" He cracks a little smile. \"Anyway, the pale is no more terrifying than, say, water. Or death. Or that we're stuck behind our eyes, for all eternity...\" He looks around, pensive suddenly.",
		"\"Are they? They're mostly just cumbersome.\"",
		"\"Mhm.\"",
		"\"Next I suppose you're going to tell me you need to form a *committee* to assign this *responsabilité*?\"",
		"\"If it helps you work better, okay. See it as competition. But don't expect me to. Now...\"",
		"\"Uhhh...\" He scratches his cheek. \"I'm really not sure about this turn of events. I may have preferred the mutton chops. They sort of seemed to... cover up the...\" He stops.",
		"He purses his lips. \"The victim wasn't run over by a drunk driver, so, while I can't condone your driving habits, the cases remain unrelated...\"",
		"He studies your face for signs of offence. \"Don't take it personally -- it's just that security guards kept on by large corporations tend to be better trained and better armed than officers of the RCM.\"",
		"\"I have no idea what you're talking about.\"",
		"\"Alright, I guess there is *one* thing...\"",
		"\"Focus on *other* people's troubles. Not your own. That is the relief.\"",
		"\"As you know, there was considerable interest in this case at my station, but probably not for the reasons you have in mind...\"",
		"\"And now I do,\" he nods.",
		"\"Okay. And something happened in that brain?\"",
		"\"It's just stupidity.\" The lieutenant shakes his head.",
		"\"You know who might be, though? That Mr. Heidelstam, the gentleman near the Feld building with the... distinctive way of speaking.\"",
		"\"Was there something else you wished to discuss?\"",
		"\"That's right.\"",
		"The lieutenant considers your question a moment. Before answering: \"No, it's not a particularly mysterious case.\"",
		"The lieutenant nods.",
		"\"Just because *your* precinct has a reputation for cracking skulls doesn't mean that's the *only* way to solve a case... Was there anything else?\"",
		"\"How about we 'hit' the crime we came here for instead. And by 'hit' I mean 'solve' it. Solve it *hard*.\"",
		"\"The belt is missing. That's it. Do you see anything else in there? I have another bag here...\"",
		"\"Do-eth thou also thorough inventories?\" He points to the ruined notes. \"You should take stock of your notes, make sure it's all there. Official notes contain informants' names. If some of it has fallen into the hands of the RCM's adversaries, bloodletting may well ensue.\"",
		"\"I see, yes. You're what we call a *bad ass*, aren't you?\" He makes little quotation marks around the words, indicating he is unsure of its actual badassery.",
		"With effort, he looks at you.",
		"\"None. Because they don't exist.\"",
		"Soggy cartons and rags look back at him. \"Oh yes -- and it would also be appropriate to start taking notes on the case. It's what cops do.\"",
		"\"The strange thing is -- we don't have to.\" He smiles. \"We have the *key* remember. The manager gave you the key.\"",
		"\"We're just in time.\" The lieutenant peers in. \"This hasn't been emptied for over a week.\"",
		"\"Alright. We should go to Garte again and ask if he knows who put the clothes in the trash. It could be as simple as someone from the hostel cleaning the yard, or *that* one...\" He nods toward the red-haired boy behind him. \"I'd advise *against* confronting that force.\"",
		"The lieutenant nods, then looks back into the trash container.",
		"\"I don't know either...\" He points to the ruined notes. \"You should take stock of your notes, make sure it's all there. Official notes contain informants' names. If some have fallen into the hands of the RCM's adversaries, bloodletting may well ensue.\"",
		"\"What do you mean *feel*?\"",
		"\"All the detectives from all the Precincts who experience extrasensory perception go to the Remote Viewers Division. Their work is invaluable to the force.\"",
		"\"Officer,\" the lieutenant adds, \"This is sensitive information. You need to take this seriously.\"",
		"\"We could try using a prybar -- the one you took from my motor carriage. Or...\"",
		"His gaze is focused on something nebulous in the far distance. On nothing in particular.",
		"\"No, because they don't exist.\"",
		"\"Officer, is that your... paperwork?\"",
		"\"It is, look...\" He points to the clipboard. \"The plastic has the RCM street grid on it. You've even got an autopsy form in there...\" A miserable looking slip of paper sticks to the board.",
		"\"If you don't mind me asking -- how did this get in the trash?\"",
		"\"Drop them in here, officer.\" The lieutenant produces a black plastic bag marked *evidence* from his pocket.",
		"\"Understood.\" He nods, reverting his attention to the container, still stinking in front of you.",
		"He nods. Absent-mindedly, he reaches for a cigarette; no sooner has it left his pocket than he catches himself.",
		"The lieutenant greets you with a small nod, as if you'd just taken a momentary pause to tie a shoelace.",
		"\"There isn't -- but we should still access this container.\"",
		"\"It would also not hurt to start taking notes on the case. Anyway, where were we...\" The lieutenant peers into the trash container where soggy cartons and rags stink uninvitingly.",
		"The lieutenant averts his eyes as you crawl into the trash container.",
		"Darkness engulfs you. The stink of rot nearly knocks you out. For a minute you can smell cigarette smoke wafting in from outside -- then it is gone, and you hear footsteps walking away.",
		"\"Interesting.\" The lieutenant looks at the mug. \"Reminds me of the mug collection we saw in our weasel's apartment. Maybe he or she has been dumping their garbage here?\"",
		"\"The quality of metal is not the problem. From what I see, it's sturdy enough.\"",
		"\"That's one thing off the list...\" The lieutenant sounds relieved. \"I think we got it all.\"",
		"\"Lucky we found it. You should take stock of what remains, just to be sure some has not made it into the hands of the RCM's adversaries. Organized crime and the like. There might have been police secrets in your notes.\"",
		"\"Yes.\" He nods. \"I think the clothes were taken off to get to that armour he wore, then discarded. They must have stripped him of it fast, too, the scavengers -- in a matter of days.\"",
		"The lieutenant leans in to inspect the lock.",
		"\"Officer...\" the lieutenant says. \"Now that you have your ledger back, it would not hurt to start taking notes on the case. Officially.\"",
		"\"Or it may just be a coincidence. Either way, something to keep in mind. What else do you see?\"",
		"\"What are you *talking* about?\"",
		"\"Yes.\" He nods. \"...if we're still assuming the clothes were taken off to get to the armour. They must have stripped him of it fast, the scavengers. In a matter of days.\"",
		"\"Oh.\" He pauses. \"It *might* also be evidence. The mob could have disposed of something in there. We should get it open.\"",
		"\"Trash? Food waste from the cafeteria? They lock these containers to keep the derelicts from flocking in. Could be evidence too.\"",
		"\"We should return later, officer. I don't think we were thorough enough. There may be more in there.\"",
		"\"This is a military type over-garment. No label or serial number -- this is the kind of rib-knit shirt that's worn over light armour to conceal it in an urban scenario...\" He nods to himself. \"Anything more?\"",
		"\"Yes it is, look.\" He points to it. \"This plastic has the RCM street grid on it. You've even got an autopsy form...\" A miserable looking slip of paper sticks to the board.",
		"\"It would also not hurt to start taking notes on the case.\" He peers into the trash, where soggy cartons and rags stink, uninvitingly. \"Now, tell me what your eagle eyes see. Or are we finished?\"",
		"\"Mhm.\" He leans in to inspect the lock.",
		"\"Or we could ask for a key from the manager of the Whirling-in-Rags. He probably has one.\"",
		"\"Information from that *source* has truly been invaluable to the investigation. I cannot wait to hear more.\"",
		"\"Boring? Try *dangerous*. You should do a thorough inventory of that -- be sure some has not fallen into the hands of the RCM's enemies: organized crime, or worse... Official notes sometimes contain informants' names, even undercover operatives.\"",
		"\"We should still access this container. There may be evidence in there.\"",
		"\"You are. The prybar is quite satisfying and handy.\" He nods, without the slightest hint of irony. \"But you are just not good enough at prying. We should get the keys.\"",
		"\"Looks like we found your paperwork.\"",
		"\"Tell me, does your bad ass see more in there or are we done here?\" The lieutenant peers into the trash.",
		"He puts the cigarette back, and says: \"Me too.\"",
		"\"Good night, detective,\" he says, with more gentleness than you've heard from him before.",
		"\"I agree. We should get someone from the Remote Viewers Division here.\"",
		"\"We could try using a prybar -- there's one in my motor carriage. Or...\"",
		"\"Mhm...\" The lieutenant briefly glances at the mug, then returns his sight to the trash.",
		"\"See?\"",
		"He is as silent as the night.",
		"Darkness engulfs you. The stink of rot nearly knocks you out. For a minute you can smell cigarette smoke wafting in from outside.",
		"\"There's a *lot* of it too.\" He nods approvingly. \"*And* you've got an autopsy form in there -- in the back. That light pink copy paper.\" A miserable looking slip of paper sticks to the board.",
		"A few words also come through the metal: \"Good night, detective.\" But they dissipate around you like the smoke; you hear the lieutenant's footfall carry him away.",
		"\"Let's ask the manager for the key, this is clearly not working.\"",
		"\"Cadaverine odour is faint.\" The lieutenant smells them. \"If these belonged to the deceased, they were removed when he was still in the early stages of decay.\"",
		"\"*Guitar* mark blue jeans. Pockets empty.\" The lieutenant quickly searches the jeans. \"Or *emptied*? He wore them with a belt, too, a wide belt -- the loops appear stretched, but...\" He looks into the container.",
		"\"Officer, this is an official piece of paperwork. It probably contains notes on *numerous* ongoing investigations -- and could even list undercover operatives. Informants. I suggest integrating it into your *style*. For all our sakes.\"",
		"\"Well...\" He doesn't know what to say.",
		"\"Did he? I must have drifted away... somewhere between the copious mentions of pigs and homo-sexuality.\"",
		"\"There isn't.\"",
		"\"No-no. We need to investigate now.\" Just like that, he opens the lid.",
		"\"Not really. All we know is -- the victim's clothes are in the trash, the lid was locked, and this establishment had the key. It's just a *small* loose thread.\"",
		"\"Tell me, *see-eth* your bad ass more in there or are we done here?\" The lieutenant peers into the trash.",
		"\"We *might* want to ask for a key from the manager of the Whirling-in-Rags. He probably has one. And he also has *information*.\"",
		"From the corner of his eye, the lieutenant gives your feet a worried glance. Rain drips from his glasses.",
		"The lieutenant nods, then looks east.",
		"The lieutenant nods, then looks east.",
		"\"This rain will not let up any time soon. You should get a raincoat. There's a Frittte to the east. They sell them there.\"",
		"\"This rain will not let up any time soon. At least we're dressed for it -- let's keep moving.\"",
		"\"This rain will not let up any time soon. I'd recommend you put on your coat.\"",
		"\"What do I think?\" He tilts his head. \"A mob of people brought someone to the tree. Not by dragging -- probably by carrying him.\"",
		"\"I do.\" The lieutenant marks something in his notebook. \"One of them carried him over.\"",
		"\"It does.\" He looks around. \"I shouldn't have assumed in the first place. The caller could have lied, the whole thing could be misreported. Should we take another look? Or go?\"",
		"\"Yes, well.\" The lieutenant thinks for a moment. \"He *did* look a bit like a rat, you're right. Do you think those prints belong to him?\"",
		"He makes a note in his blue binder: \"Is there anything else that's noteworthy here?\"",
		"\"So far so good -- only one thing missing.\" He looks at the tracks, face lighting up from the realization.",
		"\"Interesting -- let's name it the Odd-Sole.\"",
		"\"Mhm.\" He takes his glasses off and cleans them.",
		"\"The case is not solved,\" he says without a speck of laughter. \"However.\"",
		"\"Perhaps it could be a *driver*? A driver would wear out their right shoe before the left. The accelerator is on the right.\"",
		"\"I could still be wrong, but... I'm probably not.\"",
		"\"Yes, well...\" He quickly disregards your statement as another one of your outbursts.",
		"\"We should see what Titus Hardie has got to say on the matter -- this might throw them off, work in our advantage...\" He writes something down into his little notebook. \"So, what else?\"",
		"\"A woman or a kid?\"",
		"\"He appears to be wearing some kind of armoured boots. I can't see any exotic prints here...\" His face muscles twitch. \"Someone had to carry him. Are any of the other prints deep enough?\"",
		"\"What do I think? A mob of people brought something heavy to the tree. One of them was carrying the victim. They shuffled around, especially under the tree.\"",
		"\"Hmm, maybe you're right and it's someone else... although I doubt it.\"",
		"\"Very well.\"",
		"\"Two hundred?\" He thinks for a moment. \"Could it be the combined weight of two people, one carrying the other who's tied up? Let's say, a heavily built worker carrying a similarly built, soon-to-be-dead man?\"",
		"\"Even easier to carry on a stretcher -- or between two men. Anyway, it's for future consideration. What else can you see?\"",
		"The lieutenant's eyes narrow. He's thinking to himself.",
		"\"No. These prints are pretty standard.\"",
		"\"I never got the hang of it. Hyperopia.\" He points to his glasses. \"Any of them look familiar? Are these the Hardies?\"",
		"\"Which means that the missing lady driver was also present at the lynching? That's it, she's the odd-sole!\"",
		"\"There's one pair missing from the Union box. The eighth pair. I'm going to say it was our odd-sole.\"",
		"\"Mhm.\" He looks to the holes in the mud. \"I counted twenty. I take it it's less than that.\"",
		"\"Which ones?\"",
		"\"I don't know why I said that. We're not looking for a drummer, we're looking for a group of dockworkers.\"",
		"\"A drummer only uses their right foot for the kick drum...\" He explains, then stops and looks at the hole in the mud. \"You're right, it's stupid.\"",
		"\"By these tracks, yes.\"",
		"\"An obese person is becoming less likely.\"",
		"\"Mhm. I think we have arrived at a conclusion here.\"",
		"\"Understood. Anything else?\"",
		"\"So maybe one of them wasn't a dockworker but a *driver*?\" His eyes narrow. \"That traffic jam in front of the harbour gates -- I wonder if it's lasted as long as the strike?\"",
		"\"You're right. Let's keep a low profile.\" The lieutenant writes something down in his notebook, then reverts to the tracks in the mud.",
		"He doesn't seem to hear you, looking south toward the traffic jam instead. The machines are silent, the engines are all turned off...",
		"\"How many?\" The lieutenant has been tracking your eyes' movements.",
		"\"I can't see any prints fitting the armoured boots the victim was wearing, can you? Someone had to carry him. Are any of the *other* prints deep enough?\"",
		"\"Yes, they could have used a makeshift stretcher or just marched him up to the gallows.\"",
		"\"Someone operating a work bench -- with a pedal? Like a joiner at the harbour?\" He thinks for a second. \"Or maybe a drummer...\"",
		"\"Probably yes. This would also fit with the victim being dead from a previous gunshot wound. They had to carry him, because he could no longer walk.\"",
		"\"Exactly. They had to perform it to whoever was looking -- the whole neighbourhood, I suppose.\" He adds: \"And us too.\"",
		"\"Yes... a drummer. I don't know about a drummer. Seems tangential. However.\"",
		"\"I agree,\" he clears his throat. \"Our assumptions could be wrong. Better not to have them confirmed just yet. Do you see anything else?\"",
		"\"Uhm...\" His face is one of disbelief. The words coming out of your mouth are filled with such sincerity.",
		"\"Yes, it was naive of me to congratulate us. Assumptions are dangerous.\" He looks around. \"Do you see anything else?\"",
		"His eyebrows arch. They are the liveliest part of his otherwise quite inexpressive face:",
		"\"A morbidly obese 250 kilogram man? Let's say it is a very *low* probability. I'm thinking...\" He looks around. \"Maybe there's a more *commonplace* explanation.\"",
		"\"I don't know...\" The lieutenant squints, trying to assess their depth: \"Are you sure? I could swear you're *lying* to me.\"",
		"\"Okay. How do you know?\"",
		"\"Mhm. If it fits too well, we might be missing something. What do you see?\"",
		"\"Mhm.\"",
		"\"Seven sets of tracks, right?\" The lieutenant has been tracking your eyes' movements. \"The Hardie boys were here...\"",
		"\"Yes.\" He corrects his glasses. \"I doubt the Hardies are going to tell us much, but we should still confront them about the possible drug trade connection.\"",
		"\"Yes.\" He corrects his glasses. \"I doubt the Hardies are going to tell us who this person is. For now it's best if we just keep our eyes open -- I'm sure our investigation will eventually lead us to the odd-sole.\"",
		"\"Maybe it *wasn't*?\"",
		"\"Yes, it would seem we are -- both -- from the police.\"",
		"\"I pulled last week's forecast for coastal Revachol. Seven days below freezing. The day before -- the day of his hanging -- was the last warm day.\"",
		"\"Then after hoisting him up, they stood in a semicircle facing his direction. At first glance, this appears to be a lynching.\"",
		"The lieutenant looks around, tracing your eyes on the tracks.",
		"\"As I said, I pulled last week's forecast for coastal Revachol. Seven days below freezing. The day before his hanging was the last warm day.\"",
		"\"Don't beat yourself down -- neither can I. We'll have another look later.\"",
		"\"You have a point there.\" He clicks his pen, thinking for a moment. \"Anyway, it's something to consider. What else can you see?\"",
		"\"I never got the hang of it. Hyperopia.\" He points to his glasses. \"Do you see anything out of the ordinary?\"",
		"\"I'm not assuming it isn't. But it's still helpful -- is there anything else?\"",
		"The lieutenant is saying something, but you can't hear it... Suddenly it seems like your tie is alive again, whispering -- no, *screaming* -- into your ear:",
		"\"We should start with Titus Hardie, see what he's got to say on the matter -- this might throw them off, work in our advantage...\" He writes something down into his little notebook. \"So, what else?\"",
		"\"From here, the boots the victim wears...\" The lieutenant stops mid sentence. A sudden change in wind direction blows the stench of rotting meat right in your face. He tries to continue...",
		"\"Wind keeps changing... are any of the prints deep enough in your opinion?\"",
		"The lieutenant looks at you curiously. A beat passes in silence, the wind blowing, the cargo belt squeaking.",
		"\"Do you think there's something we're missing?\"",
		"\"Perhaps it could be a *driver?*\" He raises his index finger. \"A driver would wear out their right shoe before the left. The accelerator is on the right.\"",
		"\"Now we know who's the missing eighth person at the lynching. Do you think that Hardie and his boys could also be involved in the drug operation?\"",
		"\"Yes.\" He corrects his glasses. \"I doubt the Hardies are going to tell us much, but we should still confront them about the possible drug trade connection.\"",
		"\"That's a tree. I think we're close to a conclusion here.\"",
		"\"What do you see?\" The lieutenant cleans his glasses, squinting at the shapes in the mud.",
		"\"Is that so? Well, okay I guess. If it helps with the police-work, by all means. Do you see anything else?\"",
		"\"Either way...\" he concludes. \"What else?\"",
		"\"I don't know...\" He inspects the odd sole more closely. \"They're about the same size. Not the same *boot*, no -- but they *could* be the same person.\"",
		"\"She is. And now we have concrete evidence binding everything together. We should ask Titus about this.\"",
		"\"The fat guy from the mess hall isn't *that* obese, he's more like a farm boy -- definitely not 250 kilograms on his own. You have to admit, he's the best fit we've got.\"",
		"\"A week maybe? Seven days would fit the time frame provided to us by the caller, who reported the hanging.\"",
		"Say: \"I'm experiencing a mild malfunction, lieutenant. Something to do with my tie. It'll pass, can you hold on for a moment?\"",
		"\"Noted.\" The lieutenant takes out his little notebook.",
		"\"You're right. But we should still go and see what Titus Hardie has got to say on the matter -- this might throw them off, work in our advantage...\" He writes something down into his little notebook. \"So, what else?\"",
		"\"Uhm... detective?\" He's staring at you as you clutch your necktie.",
		"\"I was pretty off then. I counted 20.\"",
		"Silence. The lieutenant takes his glasses off and cleans them.",
		"\"Mhm,\" he nods enthusiastically. \"And I was thinking it *wasn't* the Giant of Koko Nur.\"",
		"\"Mmmhm...\" The thought pleases him.",
		"\"Mhm.\" The lieutenant writes the information down in his notebook, then reverts to the tracks in the mud.",
		"\"We've identified one of the footprints, but there are still seven to go...\" He writes something in his little blue notebook.",
		"\"Understood. We should still go and see what Titus Hardie has got to say on the matter -- this might throw them off, work in our advantage...\" He writes something down into his little notebook. \"So, what else?\"",
		"\"I assumed you were counting.\"",
		"\"Possibly, yes.\" The lieutenant marks something down in his notebook.",
		"\"It could have been -- but if it *wasn't*...\" He waits for you to finish the sentence.",
		"\"You mean a display of athletic ability meant to belittle the victim? A local champion carrying the intruder alone? I can see it. Anyway -- the others?\"",
		"\"Yes, you are after all, The Law. We are the law of the land.\"",
		"\"We should keep our eyes open around the traffic jam, see whether anyone strikes out as a potential suspect. Seems prudent, no?\"",
		"\"Wide open,\" he says without a speck of laughter. \"The expression is *blew the shit wide open*.\"",
		"\"I do.\" The lieutenant marks something in his notebook. \"The fat guy, I think I heard them call him Angus -- most likely to have carried the victim over.\"",
		"\"That so? Interesting. Then one of them seems to be missing. Anything else out of the ordinary?\"",
		"\"Mhmh. Which one is missing do you think?\" He quickly adds: \"I'm going to say it was our odd-sole.\"",
		"\"That's okay,\" he nods, \"go on.\"",
		"\"No, it's not. Forget I said it, we're not looking for a drummer.\"",
		"\"It still doesn't rule Ruby out. People change shoes, after all. But this isn't an argument for her guilt either.\"",
		"\"But we *know* the victim had a bullet in his head. A more precise way to put it is: it was *made* to look like a lynching.\"",
		"\"I'm guessing that's the skinny Hardie boy, the one with his front teeth missing.\"",
		"\"With a piece of sandpaper glued to the throttle...\" The lieutenant adjusts his glasses as his eyes light up with excitement.",
		"The lieutenant follows the tracks with his gaze. \"That's plausible. A similar... reckless abandon seems to be in evidence.\"",
		"\"You are correct. This is a rather motor carriage-friendly city.\"",
		"\"No wonder the cafeteria manager seemed frustrated when he was giving us directions to the yard.\"",
		"\"Well,\" he gestures toward the gaping hole in the fence, \"you did provide us with a very convenient access point to the crime scene.\"",
		"\"Yes, it is. Well,\" he gestures toward the gaping hole in the fence, \"you did provide us with a very convenient access point to the crime scene.\"",
		"\"I'm not sure... there are plenty of traffic accidents waiting to happen in Martinaise. With the jam right here on the roundabout. I would keep them separate.\"",
		"\"Not much. I don't have a *fresh perspective* on it. Shall we go?\"",
		"He nods. \"We should focus on present crimes -- from the present century.\"",
		"\"There?\" He looks to the wall. \"Those are *old*.\"",
		"\"These bullets were fired during the Revolution, over half a century ago. They do not warrant investigation.\"",
		"\"Yes, the one that happened half a century ago.\" He blinks. \"Those bullets were fired during the Revolution and do not warrant an investigation by officers of civil law.\"",
		"\"Where?\" He looks around.",
		"\"I don't. Let's go.\"",
		"\"It's not going to be that easy. We need to dirty our hands with the signatures.\" He looks around. \"I assume that's the goal here.\"",
		"\"Alright, let's go back to Evrart.\" The lieutenant turns towards the industrial harbour. \"If we don't mention anything to him, he won't know before it's too late.\"",
		"The lieutenant pats the box on the head, ever so slightly, before walking away.",
		"The lieutenant pats the box, ever so slightly.",
		"\"Cool.\" The lieutenant nods approvingly. \"You really showed that mail collection box.\"",
		"\"Other than kicking?\"",
		"\"Yes. For sending mail.\"",
		"\"Let's go back to Evrart.\" The lieutenant turns towards the industrial harbour. \"This better be worth it -- after what we did.\"",
		"\"But why? We work twelve-hour shifts. We get shot at, spat on...\"",
		"\"Hmh...\" Just a hum. No reply.",
		"The lieutenant raises his eyebrows, then sighs.",
		"\"But we *are* the police...\"",
		"The lieutenant looks at the wall in dismay:",
		"\"Very poetic.\" The lieutenant nods in appreciation -- it doesn't sound sincere. \"Real poetry. Should we return to our murder investigation? I hear there's a really *bad* one we're supposed to solve.\"",
		"\"Which the assistant detective *inexplicably* reported to me as X5415- something. Why was that, assistant detective?\"",
		"He produces a measuring tape: \"Well nourished, athletically built measuring 1.80 metres. Generally consistent with age 42. Preservation is good, ambient temperature below freezing.\"",
		"\"Of course, I under-compensated.\" He pockets the tape.",
		"\"The steel wiring...\" he concedes -- breathless, \"there's too much of it. We *need* to remove the belt so we can get to the ligature mark.\"",
		"\"Ligature mark...\" The lieutenant produces a small folding knife. With the other hand pulling on the belt, he starts cutting into the polyester. The stench is horrid. After a while, it's obvious the material cannot be cut.",
		"The lieutenant looks relieved. \"Back is symmetrical and intact. Upper and lower extremities are intact -- but asymmetrical. There are old combat injuries on the right hand, thigh, and hip.\"",
		"With his eyes almost closed, the lieutenant puts his hand on the dead man's throat and begins to massage it, gently. A rotting smell erupts from the mouth. Purge fluid runs down his lips -- black and viscous.",
		"\"Are you a hepatobiliary expert?\" He looks at the corpse's stomach with a mixture of tiredness and disgust.",
		"This appears to be a case investigated about three weeks ago -- a workplace accident. The titular character's wife tried to get *compensation*. The company was not forthcoming. It's hard to make out if the hole was fatal.",
		"There's a pause. \"I don't think we should mention that. Better not to muddy the waters.\"",
		"\"That's right. What's next?\"",
		"\"Then -- given the state of decay here, I consider establishing the victim's ethnicity a minor success.\"",
		"\"However, a piece of professional advice. The next time you encounter a list of topics with numbers on them -- start with 1. Then: 2. Then: 3. Lists are numbered for a reason.\"",
		"\"We've heard a nom de guerre -- Lely. It's better than nothing. Write it down.\"",
		"\"The chest was intact, normal contours. Abdomen protuberant, pelvis intact. No injuries in genital region.\"",
		"\"Fine,\" the lieutenant sighs. \"It's a three-part form to be filled out on the scene, by the detectives responsible. One takes notes, the other dictates. The goal is to establish cause of death.\"",
		"\"Mhm,\" he nods. \"We have a real museum here. Of battles, wars...\"",
		"\"And what would that make the alphanumeric?\"",
		"\"Damn corpse. We had a good rhythm going...\" The lieutenant gets up and brushes his pants.",
		"\"The rope rises to a point, leaving a *gap* in the ligature mark. The suspension point is in the back of the neck.\" The lieutenant has kneeled closer, running his finger along the dark red groove -- until there's a gap.",
		"\"Genitalia is male and unremarkable. No evidence of injury.\"",
		"\"Ah, yes -- your hunch, before.\" He takes a moment to breathe. \"We could have a semen analysis requested from Processing, but we're already requesting toxicology. There's a one test limit.\"",
		"\"Back is symmetrical and intact.\" He struggles to turn the corpse on his side. \"Upper and lower extremities are intact, but asymmetrical. There are combat injuries on the right hand, thigh, and hip.\"",
		"\"Okay, so there's an incision on the thorax, from a chaincutter.\" There's a pause. \"I wouldn't mention it. Better not to muddy the waters.\"",
		"He nods. \"Head, chest, and scalp bite mark injuries. Predation by birds has caused damage to the body. Odontologist does not need to be consulted.\"",
		"\"And your opinion, officer?\" Beneath the description there are two boxes waiting to be ticked:",
		"\"For god's sake, leave the box unticked then. What next?\"",
		"\"Why do you say that?\" He tilts his head.",
		"\"Hmm, yes. I didn't want to mention it before, but you really should find your clothes.\" He looks at his notebook.",
		"\"Very dramatic. Nevertheless, I would appreciate it if you'd just put your clothes back on.\" He looks at his notebook.",
		"\"They're better than nothing...\" The lieutenant looks at the gloves. \"Tell you what: I perform the anatomical side of things, while you will take notes.\"",
		"\"In your paperwork, officer. Just fill out the field autopsy form.\" He sighs, already expecting the answer.",
		"\"I mean when I need you to. Until then -- I should handle physical contact and you should take notes.\"",
		"\"It's either this, *or* we complete the initial interviews. We already met Evrart, but didn't *quite* get his interview done -- for that we would have to ask him about the *lynching*. Like we did with Joyce.\"",
		"\"Mhm.\" He shows you the point on the man's neck where belt cuts into the flesh. \"Cut with as much *precision* as you can, please.\"",
		"\"Lividity *appears* consistent with hanging -- but is not. The head is congested. Contusions are present on the head and chest -- consistent with stones thrown postmortem; low velocity...\"",
		"\"That's right,\" he nods.",
		"\"Interfering with the body's position or wounds postmortem.\"",
		"\"The boots are ceramic, vitreous enamel. They're fused to his skin from blood flowing downward postmortem. Removal of the boots is left for Processing.\"",
		"\"The boot has a serial number.\" He twists the dead man's foot: \"It's E50.100.1000. The lines between the plates are in the shape of the alphanumerical. The number is purposefully concealed by the design.\"",
		"\"That's wonderful, officer. My opinion of you has lowered. Go ahead, write down a stupid nonsensical number in the autopsy form too -- instead of E50.100.1000.\"",
		"\"Ah, yes -- your hunch, before. We can have a semen analysis requested -- from Processing -- if that's what you meant.\"",
		"\"That's it.\"",
		"It's very hard to draw conclusions. All you can make out is that he is in a hurry to solve the case -- the tempo of the handwriting says as much -- and that there are *a lot* of notes in there. Most of them are made prior to arriving at the scene, in preparation.",
		"\"I'm afraid we can only fill this in once the belt is removed from his neck and we have visual on the injury.\"",
		"\"Now?\" He pockets it. \"Now we put him in a body bag and I drive him to Faubourg -- for processing...\"",
		"\"This, I remind you, also necessitates the removal of the belt from around his neck. So we have a visual on the injury.\"",
		"\"Let's not go *glove-hunting*, please. Let's use division of labour -- I perform the anatomical side, while you take notes.\"",
		"\"I'll ask you when I need you to. For the most part, maybe I should handle the contact and you take notes?\"",
		"\"What's next -- date of birth?\"",
		"\"No, let's fill out the info form first.\"",
		"\"Male.\"",
		"\"Note. The boot has a hidden serial number on it.\" He crouches, twisting the dead man's foot: \"It's E50.100.1000...\"",
		"\"Nothing. Just in case.\"",
		"\"Right. Next?\"",
		"\"That's it.\" He cracks an uneasy smile. \"We have established cause of death. It's not much -- and it leaves much to be questioned -- but it's a *start*.\"",
		"\"Hmh...\" The lieutenant falls silent, abruptly.",
		"\"Okay. *Why* don't you think it was fatal?\"",
		"\"We also requested a toxicological screening -- that was thorough. The results should arrive in a couple of weeks. If we're lucky. I would not hold my breath...\"",
		"\"Yes... well.\" The lieutenant doesn't know what to say.",
		"\"That's right. No clawing marks on the neck, no signs of struggle on the crime scene. And a witness statement from the perpetrators all confirm: wound is post-mortem. Treatment.\"",
		"\"Clothes,\" he begins. \"The deceased...\" He blinks, staring at the body. \"The deceased *used* to wear a pair of armoured boots -- they're gone now. Interesting.\"",
		"\"Maybe you *should*?\" He looks at his blue notebook and sighs.",
		"\"Whooh...\" He turns to the side to breathe -- it's not enough. He buries his face in the sleeve of his jacket. You hear a muffled voice: \"That's *all* for the external. Well done! What next?\"",
		"\"Let's see, what did we find...\" He scratches his chin as he leafs through his notes. \"We observed haemorrhaging on the skin above and below the ligature mark. Well pronounced, consistent with a drop from 1 or 1.5 metres.\"",
		"\"It's either this, *or* we complete the initial interviews. We already met Evrart -- that only leaves the Wild Pines representative. There's one in town, negotiating the strike. She could have information.\"",
		"\"Yes. Barely.\" He looks at his blue notebook and sighs.",
		"\"Let's.\" The lieutenant nods.",
		"\"That's you.\"",
		"\"Babroudine, yes. Inexpensive. Size M. Colour: white.\"",
		"\"Haemorrhaging is observed on the skin above and below the ligature mark. The mark is well pronounced, consistent with a drop from 1 or 1.5 metres.\"",
		"\"Neither am I.\"",
		"You find a moment, as the lieutenant inspects the dead man's fingernails. Just a few glances. The pages are filled with a bulky freehand that's nearly illegible...",
		"\"Or the incision on the thorax -- from a chaincutter? Neither was a team effort. And I wouldn't mention them. Muddies the water.\"",
		"\"Losing your paperwork is not a small issue. I'm sorry if I came off as patronizing.\" He looks at his notebook.",
		"\"Back was symmetrical and intact, upper and lower extremities also -- but asymmetrical.\" The lieutenant nods along to his meticulous overview. \"Old combat injuries on the right hand, thigh, and hip.\"",
		"\"Somewhere *else*?\"",
		"\"Not much later, I hope.\" He looks at the man's rotting remains. \"He's about to... *melt away* soon.\"",
		"\"Good. Now, the way I see it...\" He looks at the corpse with some disgust...",
		"\"I'm not seeing anything yet -- but we *know* there's tampering here.\" He thinks. \"Write down: Yes. Non-visual. Corroborated by witness (see report).\"",
		"\"Sorry doesn't cut it here. Let's move on.\"",
		"\"Officer, what *haven't* you lost?\"",
		"\"We should locate your ledger, then hurry back to the autopsy as soon as possible.\"",
		"\"Hands are clean,\" the lieutenant says as five cold, sausage-like fingers slip from your hand. \"No sign of injury from struggling.\"",
		"... then: \"Digested semisolid food in stomach -- voilà.\" He touches the corpse's bloated lower abdomen -- briefly.",
		"Maybe you're imagining it, but there are some remarks in there -- and they're not all negative! You're referred to as 'the 41st' -- by your station number. And...",
		"\"Okay. So there's a spin-stabilized munition -- from a Kiejl A9/90 muzzleloader -- lodged in his lung.\"",
		"The lieutenant's admission has caused great gratitude in Cuno. He is silent with it.",
		"\"No-no officer, I'm afraid I disagree now. We should leave the question open -- at least for the time being. If necessary, I can always amend this later. In my paperwork.\"",
		"\"We should start the postmortem.\"",
		"\"The upper torso is covered in a single tattoo, beginning on the right shoulder and reaching around the heart. The shape is abstract. The ink is blue and white.\"",
		"\"Yes.\" He covers his nose and lists: \"One, investigation of the scene. Two, inital examination of the victim. Three, field autopsy. Four, transportation of the body to the morgue. We're on number three.\"",
		"\"Good call.\"",
		"\"You told me the wrong serial number.\" The lieutenant grows very still. \"Why would you do that? Why would you jeopardize your own crime scene? And now the boots are gone, too. This could have been a lead.\"",
		"\"Good. Otherwise you would only have *one* shoe, now...\" He looks at his notebook.",
		"\"Next?\"",
		"\"Hmh,\" the lieutenant corrects his glasses: \"roughly 50.\"",
		"\"Just leave it empty, officer.\"",
		"\"Clothes,\" he begins. \"The deceased wears armoured boots and white briefs. The make of the briefs is Babroudine I think. Let's see...\" He turns the body onto its side to check the underwear label.",
		"The lieutenant watches you, in silence.",
		"\"Muscoskeletal -- purge fluid is coming from the mouth.\" He gets close to the swollen mouth-hole, eyes squinting from the fumes: \"Not injury related. Eyes and tongue protuberant. Hyoid bone... let's see.\"",
		"\"The hyoid bone is *fractured*,\" he says after a while. \"The rest of the muscoskeletal system is intact, unremarkable.\"",
		"\"Cardiovascular. The body exhibits lividity in the lower extremities -- feet, hands, and neck -- visually consistent with a hanging.\"",
		"\"We were not *too* sloppy with the injuries. We did not describe the contusions. We did not provide an opinion. But given the circumstances -- it is excusable. And they were clearly not fatal.\"",
		"\"The next time you encounter a list of topics with numbers on it -- start with 1. Then 2. Then 3. Lists are numbered for a reason. It is the *intended* order.\"",
		"\"Very dramatic. Nevertheless, I would appreciate it if you'd at least put your jacket back on.\" He looks at his notebook.",
		"\"Come on, officer.\" He pulls on a pair of  latex gloves. \"You know what a field autopsy is. You've done a hundred of them.\"",
		"\"It's either this, *or* we complete the initial interviews. We already met Evrart, but didn't *quite* get his interview done -- for that we have to ask him about the lynching. There's also a Wild Pines representative in town. She could have some information.\"",
		"\"Ellis Kortenaer -- we have a *full* name to provide here...\" He seems satisifed.",
		"\"Not particularly -- him being *dead* when they carried him over...\"",
		"\"Seriously -- I can just bag him and drive him to the morgue any time you tell me to. No need for heroics -- unless you want to...\"",
		"\"But he's still wearing his white briefs -- thank god for that. The make of the briefs is 'Babroudine' I think. Let's see...\" He turns the body onto its side to check the underwear label.",
		"\"N/A.\"",
		"\"Not an energetic start to an autopsy, I agree.\"",
		"The lieutenant looks by, somewhat worried as you summon power words to your aid.",
		"\"No you weren't, officer -- that would be preposterous.\" He shakes his head. \"Just write down that we request a semen, vaginal, and anal fluids analysis.\"",
		"\"I was. Maybe I'm just not seeing them... Honestly, the stench is making it hard for me to think at the moment.\"",
		"\"Like a toxicology screening?\" He looks at the monster. \"At this stage, I doubt Processing will find anything, even if he was brimming with cocaine. But still... you should add a request.\"",
		"\"Leave it *N/A* then.\"",
		"\"That was not a team effort. I just *missed* my shot. Also, let's not mention it. Muddies the water.\"",
		"\"Yes, it's...\" He's expecting for you to finish the sentence.",
		"\"At least for the time being.\" He nods. \"If we don't like it, I can always amend this later. In my paperwork.\"",
		"\"Lividity is consistent with hanging. The head is congested. Contusions are present on the head, chest, and thighs -- consistent with stones thrown postmortem; low velocity...\"",
		"\"Now, you see -- that worries me.\" He wipes his forehead. \"You will die if you drink -- you know that, don't you? You're proving a useful detective, the organization would miss you.\"",
		"\"Here,\" he hands you the chaincutters back and then kneels closer to the body -- running his finger along the dark red groove. Until he comes to a gap...",
		"Naively, the lieutenant does not double check your notes.",
		"\"None -- at least not after the initial examination.\"",
		"\"It's no use. We should get *chaincutters* -- you can try with them. I have a pair in the toolbox of my Kineema.\"",
		"\"Hands are clean.\" He inspects the wrist. \"No sign of a recent struggle.\"",
		"\"Hands are clean,\" the lieutenant concludes. The dead man's fingers slip from your hand, cold and sausage-like. \"No sign of injury from struggling.\"",
		"\"Respiratory system...\" Back hunched -- as if in prayer -- he begins to pry open the dead man's jaws. He stops to exert more force. Both hands are used.",
		"\"Same for toxicology and serology - N/A.\"",
		"\"Most everything *else* on the victim says otherwise...\" He pauses. \"But I agree. I was ready to establish a cause of death here, officer, but now I think we should leave it empty. At least for the time being.\"",
		"\"Unhygienically?\"",
		"\"I can give you my paperwork -- there's an autopsy form there. Several actually. But *only* if it helps move things along.\"",
		"\"No. You and I are *detectives*. The honorary rank of 'detective' signifies our ability to handle *the entire incident chain* -- from autopsy to clean-up, to social work. Everything.\"",
		"\"Not from where I look, no. But you're right. Your hunch was right. He was having sex when he died.\"",
		"\"...is what it would look like, but we know better. We *know* the ligature mark is a treatment.\" He awaits your call.",
		"\"I hope we do.\" He covers his nose. \"It's getting *really* late for an autopsy...\"",
		"\"I do: KK57-0503-0815.\"",
		"A silent nod. The lieutenant places his gloved hand on the corpse's chest -- as if in preparation...",
		"\"Yes -- and now this happened. I am perplexed. Officer, please write down the right serial number: E50.100.1000.\"",
		"\"The deceased has a steel reinforced cargo belt around his neck, tied with a hangman's knot. Colour -- yellow; length -- three metres. There is a buckle on the other end.\"",
		"He sinks the cutters into the knot, preparing to perform the cuts -- with his elbow to his knee for precision.",
		"\"In addition, I see smaller, residual scars -- too numerous to count, covering about 30% of his skin.\"",
		"And 'the 41st' comes off as a moderately competent detective.",
		"\"Well. We established probable cause of death -- some would say that's the *goal* of an autopsy.\"",
		"\"A scalpel is not always required. I hope this is one of those cases... Latex gloves are, however.\"",
		"\"Document A1. The detectives have taken a colour photograph of the markings. Photograph was produced on scene.\"",
		"\"The boots were ceramic, vitreous enamel. They were fused to his skin from blood flowing downward postmortem. They were removed postmortem by scavengers.\"",
		"\"We should find it before someone else does, then hurry back to the autopsy as soon as possible.\"",
		"\"KK57-0803.0815.\"",
		"He places his gloved hand on the dead man's chest, as if in preparation...",
		"\"It's quite possible. You lied to me for no good reason. Please write down the right serial number: E50.100.1000.\"",
		"\"Gastrointestinal,\" he breathes a sigh of approaching relief -- this is the last field on the list. He looks around -- to the ground, the pool of faeces there...",
		"It's not a glowing review, sorry to say. 'The 41st' -- as you're referred to -- comes across as somewhat less than competent. It's not *explicitly* stated that the lieutenant doesn't trust you, there's just... nothing positive in there.",
		"\"A dark red abraded ligature mark encircling the neck, with a gap on the nape measuring... let's say seven centimetres. The hyoid bone is fractured, the cervical column intact.\"",
		"\"Don't.\"",
		"\"Still... there may be truth to this one. I was ready to call a probable cause of death here -- but now I think we should leave it empty. At least for the time being.\"",
		"He raises a finger: \"It is the *intended* order. Anyway...\"",
		"The lieutenant adjusts his glasses and takes a deep breath.",
		"\"That's it. Field autopsy done, detective. All that remains is to see if the alleged cause of death -- the bullet -- is truly lodged in his brain. I'll leave that to you, colleague. *Or* to Processing -- I won't force you in there...\"",
		"\"Yes, you see...\" He points to the bright red pages at the end. \"The field autopsy form is the one on red copier paper.\"",
		"\"Last item -- hands.\" He takes the man's right hand in his, inspects it -- then moves on to the other hand...",
		"\"Haemorrhaging present in mucous,\" the lieutenant repeats impatiently. He lets go of the jaws. The mouth snaps shut before you.",
		"\"What?\"",
		"\"Oh?\" He looks incredulous: \"So *we* inflicted them?\"",
		"\"Injuries,\" he nods.",
		"\"So -- the scalp bleeds from a postmortem head injury. A stone. The injury does not have the rim of an early inflammatory response. A perpetrator on the scene has confessed to causing it postmortem...\"",
		"\"Has confessed to causing it *at maximum velocity*.\"",
		"\"We were thorough with the list of injuries too -- we described them all in detail. What is there to say? Given the circumstances, it was a professional field autopsy.\"",
		"\"To be honest, we were sloppy with the injuries. The victim has bite marks and contusions. We should have described them in detail, provided an opinion. But what's done is done -- and they're clearly not fatal.\"",
		"\"We don't always have to be so *original* about everything. Anyway...\"",
		"\"Also numerous residual scars, covering about 40% of his skin. Extensive scarring, to say the least.\" He coughs. \"Hands were clean, no sign of injury from struggling. That's about it.\"",
		"\"There truly is a time for everything -- even for yellow gardening gloves.\" He nods approvingly. \"However, they are lacking hygienically. I suggest you *get in there* in limited capacity.\"",
		"\"Fortunately we already wrote down the serial number -- E50.100.1000. Let's move on.\"",
		"\"Body hair is light brown, distribution is consistent with age.\" He kneels in to get a better look: \"The deceased had male pattern baldness. Hair is combed back, short.\"",
		"\"Khm,\" he coughs. \"Lividity is consistent with *hanging*. The head is congested. Contusions are present on the head, chest, and thighs -- consistent with stones thrown; low velocity...\"",
		"\"We only have one test, as per regulation -- and we already requested semen.\"",
		"\"What's next on the list?\"",
		"\"Be pedantic, if you like -- it doesn't matter. No one else is going to investigate this man's murder. And if they *do*, such details would only *confuse* them.\"",
		"\"Fatal injury by seagulls?\"",
		"\"Agreed -- next injury?\"",
		"\"No, he was not murdered by seagulls.\"",
		"\"Did you?\" His eyes narrow. \"I'm not so sure. I *thought* we could establish the cause of death here, officer. Now I think we should leave it empty.\"",
		"\"...for processing.\" He looks at the dead man one more time, then at the slip of red paper in his hand, then at the corpse again.",
		"\"I need a copy of that autopsy form, then I will drive him to Faubourg...\"",
		"\"Alright. Bitemarks, contusions on head and chest, and a ligature mark encircling the neck.\"",
		"\"The rope rises to a point,\" he says, \"leaving a *gap* in the ligature mark. The suspension point is in the back of the neck, on the nape.\"",
		"\"Mr. Measurehead has done a good job.\" The lieutenant nods approvingly. \"Nothing is *too* broken -- or compromised. The victim is ready for a field autopsy.\"",
		"\"It's not about cutting...\" He squints at the corpse. \"And no -- you and I are *detectives*. The honorary rank of 'detective' signifies our ability to handle *the entire incident chain* -- from autopsy to clean-up. To social work...\"",
		"\"Hm.\" The lieutenant furrows his brow. \"Not just yet -- let's get what we know *it isn't* out of the way first.\"",
		"\"Khm...\" The lieutenant scratches the back of his head. \"We already did that. Remember? We started, but we need the *chaincutters* from my motor-carriage to finish it.\"",
		"\"You've lost your paperwork, haven't you?\"",
		"\"Good. Let's go with that.\"",
		"\"We're still going with March 4th, '51.\"",
		"\"They'd *have* to have incapacitated and carried him over -- this man was more than a match for untrained dockworkers.\" He places his hand on the dead man's chest, as if in preparation...",
		"\"His head, yes -- you were about to cut off his head.\" He sinks the cutters into the knot, preparing to perform the cuts -- with his elbow to his knee for precision.",
		"You're probably imagining it -- the notes are *very* hard to decipher at a glance -- so don't draw any conclusions from this, but...",
		"\"No, it's not.\"",
		"The lieutenant looks at the dead man one more time -- then at his notebook, then at the corpse again...",
		"\"Always good to think ahead. Now...\" He points to the rope squeezing the dead man's neck.",
		"\"An honour -- and a burden -- attached to your rank once you've proven yourself able, usually after five to eight years of field work. Mine is *lieutenant-detective*.\"",
		"\"Good...\" The lieutenant falls silent. He places his gloved hand on the corpse's chest, as if in preparation...",
		"\"...that he was dead. Yes. They moved fast. This is a good treatment.\"",
		"\"Honestly, I'm not sure there *weren't* marks on his wrists. That part got blurry for me. The *stench...*\" He covers his mouth. \"But you're right. There should be signs of struggle. Let's leave the cause of death empty for the time being.\"",
		"\"I've noticed that, yes. And I must say I find it *troubling*.\" He looks at his notebook and sighs.",
		"He nods.",
		"The lieutenant pays no heed. \"In addition, there are bitemarks on the face, scalp, and chest. Consistent with predation.\"",
		"\"We need to cut the belt to see the ligature mark below. Carefully -- with as much *precision* as you can.\"",
		"\"Central nervous system,\" he says and then concludes abruptly: \"I have nothing. Do you have anything on this man's central nervous system?\"",
		"\"Oral cavity shows no lesions. The victim has received dental implants, possibly after a combat wound. Mouth swollen, haemorrhaging present in mucose of the lips and mouth.\"",
		"\"Unless you have untapped reservoirs of knowledge there?\"",
		"\"You mean the spin-stabilized munition from a Kiejl A9/90 muzzleloader lodged in his lung?\"",
		"\"We need to check the hyoid bone for damage before we can sign off on this. It's a potential fatal injury... Let's do part 2, external examination and then return.\"",
		"\"Everything that's physically on the victim says otherwise -- but I agree. I was ready to establish a cause of death, officer -- now I think we should leave it empty. At least for the time being.\"",
		"\"Honestly, I'm not sure there *weren't* marks on his wrists. That part got blurry for me. The *stench...*\" He covers his mouth. \"But you're right. I was ready to call this -- now I think we should leave it empty. At least for the time being.\"",
		"\"I'm afraid we can't continue before we've gone through both the external *and* internal examination first. Thoroughly.\"",
		"\"Unfortunately, no.\"",
		"\"If we must, then we must. Police paperwork is confidential material, officer...\" He sighs.",
		"\"You are. Your station would not have assigned you on this case if you weren't. Now...\"",
		"\"No need to be melodramatic, officer.\" He looks at his blue notebook and sighs.",
		"\"Mondial.\"",
		"\"What else?\" He looks over your shoulder. \"*9. Body identified by* is non-applicable. *10. Case number* is the same as the coroner's case.\"",
		"\"Then again -- the right lividity is easy to produce, if you know what you're doing.\" He places his hand on the dead man's chest, as if in preparation...",
		"\"Respiratory system,\" he pries the corpse's mouth back open. \"Put it down as -- oral cavity shows no lesions, mouth swollen, haemorrhaging present in mucous of the lips and mouth.\"",
		"Odd. There doesn't seem to be much about *you* in his notes. As if *you* aren't the sun around which the world revolves? Could it be that the case is not *about* you?",
		"\"I see haemorrhaging on the skin above and below the ligature mark. Depth of the mark -- one centimetre. No signs of clawing on the neck.\"",
		"\"It was a...\" He looks for the right words. \"An irregular field autopsy. We did not establish cause of death, which is supposed to be the goal of an autopsy. But... *personally*, I do not see this as a parameter for success.\"",
		"\"We weren't *too* sloppy with the injuries. We did not describe the bitemarks. We should have provided an opinion there. But, given the circumstances -- it is excusable. They were clearly not fatal.\"",
		"\"We requested a test to be run on the genitals -- that was *de règle*. The results should arrive in a couple of weeks, if we're lucky. I would not hold my breath...\"",
		"\"I suggest *I* handle the physical part of the autopsy -- and you take notes.\"",
		"\"The assistant has a colour photograph of the markings -- to be added to the case files as document A1. The photo is taken on the scene, using a Trigat Mini.\"",
		"\"Of course.\"",
		"\"Right. The autopsy form is near the end.\" He hands you his notebook and his pen.",
		"\"I fail to see *any* humour in it. Officer, please write down the right serial number: E50.100.1000.\"",
		"The lieutenant is unaware of what's happening in your head and why you're touching it. He merely expects you to write down his notes on the man's genitalia so you can move on.",
		"\"What would that be?\" He looks at you inquisitively.",
		"\"No.\"",
		"\"Add a request then. We'll know if drugs or poisons remain in his blood...\" He looks at the monster. \"At this stage, I doubt Processing will find anything, even if he was *brimming* with it.\"",
		"\"So, where were we on this?\"",
		"\"You mean the incision on the thorax, from a chaincutter? That was not a team effort. And I wouldn't mention it. Muddies the waters.\"",
		"\"Now you're just undermining yourself for the sake of it. What's *strange* is -- I agree. I was sure we had our cause of death here, and now I think we should leave it empty. At least for the time being...\"",
		"\"I guess you've got to start finding at least *some* of the things you've lost, before they hurt someone...\" He sighs.",
		"\"Khm.\" A cough. \"Lividity *appears* consistent with hanging -- but is not. The head is congested. Contusions are present on the head and chest, consistent with stones thrown; low velocity...\"",
		"\"Fortunately we already wrote down the serial number -- it begins with X5415. Let's move on.\"",
		"\"N/A -- next?\"",
		"\"Tattoos.\" He stands up, feet planted on either side of the body.",
		"\"We get chaincutters, then try with those. I have a pair in the toolbox of my Kineema.\"",
		"\"I should have a go first -- I think I have a strategy.\" He steps in and takes the chaincutters from you.",
		"\"Chest is intact.\" He presses down on it. \"Normal contour. Abdomen is protuberant, pelvis intact. Genitalia...\" He pulls down the man's underpants.",
		"\"Mhm. Just write down that we request an analysis.\"",
		"\"I think that may well be the moral of *every* story, officer.\" The lieutenant grins.",
		"\"*And* an incision on the thorax, from a chaincutter.\" There's a pause. \"I wouldn't mention those. Better not to muddy the waters.\"",
		"\"I'm not usually one to go for these... hunches. But I think I *agree*. I thought we had our cause of death here, officer...\" He shakes his head. \"Now I think we should leave it empty. At least for the time being.\"",
		"\"We can -- but I don't want to.\"",
		"He produces a small black plastic roll from his jacket -- a body bag. \"Let's wrap this up. I pronounce this field autopsy over.\"",
		"\"Very dramatic. Nevertheless, I would appreciate it if you'd at least put your shirt back on.\" He looks at his notebook.",
		"He looks around -- at the dark and lonely yard behind the hostel-cafeteria. \"*Or* we could call it a day. It incredibly late.\"",
		"\"*You* took the boots?\" He grimaces, before writing down the serial number.",
		"\"Mondial. Subgroup: Occidental -- as per your observation.\"",
		"\"Hepatobiliary. N/A.\" He wipes his brow.",
		"\"Let's see.\" He tilts his head: \"We have: bitemarks, contusions on the head and chest -- and a ligature mark encircling the neck. You'll need three fields. Leave a fourth one too...\"",
		"\"Now -- injuries.\"",
		"\"Those are mean, yes. But not that mean.\"",
		"\"Make this quick, detective.\"",
		"\"Good God. A hidden room...\"",
		"The lieutenant tilts his head, watching the light glimmer on the glass. \"So it is. I think these used to form a single system, slotted in the wall.\"",
		"He nods. \"The rest of the building seems to have been picked clean.\"",
		"\"These? No. These are old filament memories. I hope you're not expecting to find that device here -- you will be disappointed.\"",
		"\"In someone's abandoned shack. On the coast. In Martinaise...\" He looks at you. \"In Revachol.\"",
		"\"Here?\" He looks around. \"I don't see signs of recent habitation. This place is abandoned.\"",
		"\"Nothing. It's just a piece of furniture.\" He looks at the chair gathering dust.",
		"\"It's just a piece of clothing you've picked up. You do that, officer -- you collect clothes sometimes.\"",
		"\"Good lord...\"",
		"\"Yes, chemistry has many uses. In police work, too,\" the lieutenant says, deadpan.",
		"\"Feel free to come back later and 'have a blast' with these exemplars of youthful avant-gardism. But we really need to return to the present now.\"",
		"\"Some of your more, khm, *old-school* social views...\"",
		"\"High school. Harry! Your goings-on with Cuno, Andre, Acele -- the whole thing on the ice. That's why you're so *juvie*.\"",
		"\"No -- good luck with *your* report.\" The lieutenant smiles warmly.",
		"\"Talk to Captain Pryce? I'd rather not ruffle the feathers of *two* captains with my doom-mongering.\"",
		"\"Your moves on the church floor -- which, honestly, were just *jump aerobics*. Your use of the word *graffito*...\"",
		"\"I would have to tie things up in GRIH first. But... I mean, whatever is coming -- Jamrock *will* be more central to it than the harbour.\" The lieutenant turns very serious all of a sudden.",
		"\"I knew it. I knew no normal human being can run like that. He's an-honest-to-god gym teacher.\"",
		"\"They should know as soon as possible. It would do you good to deliver some positive news for a change.\"",
		"\"I do like the sound of that...\" He returns her smile.",
		"\"Well -- first I will go back to my station and write the most detailed report anyone has ever seen. It will have to be good to cover all this. Then I will have a serious talk with my captain.\"",
		"\"Of course! Contact Mike!\"",
		"\"He's one of the most highly regarded men in the force. You're lucky.\"",
		"\"Detective, we just stopped a small-scale war. Something is happening to Revachol.\" He takes a look around -- into the deepening shadows of the streets -- then pulls up his collar.",
		"\"Work *with* Pryce?\" A crooked smile quivers on his lips. \"I'm flattered, but I don't know if I...\"",
		"\"Harry... it explains *everything*. The running around. The jumping. The *shot-put*. Your inexplicable facial hair...\"",
		"\"The fact that you don't seem to *know* what homo-sexuality is...\"",
		"\"Oh god -- *Contact Mike*...\"",
		"\"Some of your more, khm, *old-school* wording choices. Your posture even. The constant *stretches*...\"",
		"\"That's not true. Jamrock is too big for one precinct. You're just understaffed. And everyone respects the 41st -- you have Captain Pryce.\"",
		"\"She and her husband were conducting the search for the phasmid. It's their discovery -- in part.\"",
		"\"He is very passionate about this.\"",
		"\"Perhaps...\" He pauses, deep in thought. \"There are people who say the Zone of Control will not hold up long. They're not on the radio -- yet. But there are parties out there...\"",
		"\"Detective, we just stopped a small-scale war. Something is happening to Revachol.\" He pulls up his collar and looks around, the cold spring light reflected in the lenses of his glasses.",
		"\"I don't know what, yet -- but it's going to be a hard spring for the RCM. We need to get ready. Infiltrate. Investigate.\"",
		"\"Your love of *retro-style* dance music. How you're able to perform a 360-degree spin-kick...\"",
		"\"The press will blow over,\" he says in a reassuring tone. \"Jamrock is lucky to have you. And it's often considered to be the greatest of the districts -- you're lucky to have it.\"",
		"\"Let's get some air. This one's far gone...\" He shakes his head silently as he turns to leave.",
		"\"Now, I'd like to have a word with you about this *side task* of yours...\"",
		"\"Wait...\" The lieutenant stops you before you can snap.",
		"\"She's just a distracted old woman. We should maybe let her get back to her things...\"",
		"\"No. You see, we've already spent too much time on this nonsensical side-errand. There's no magical fascist who's going to unwind time for you...\"",
		"\"Fine, then.\" He sighs. \"Just try not to black out again. And don't *contemplate*. We don't have time for that.\"",
		"\"That is *exactly* what I didn't want you to think...\" He sighs and turns to the woman. \"Ma'am, my partner wanted to know if you work in pale transport.\"",
		"\"Now come on, let's leave this one to her reveries.\" He shakes his head silently as he turns to leave.",
		"\"She's just a distracted old woman. Better to leave her alone.\"",
		"\"We're still on this ridiculous *side-task*, I see...\" He sighs and turns to the woman. \"Ma'am, my partner wanted to know if you work in pale transport.\"",
		"\"Just a moment, detective. Before we go, I'd like a word with you about this *side task* of yours...\"",
		"\"Great.\" The lieutenant concedes with a head shake. \"He asked the Pines rep about the pale.\"",
		"\"Ma'am, you're not responsible for what the client puts in your lorry as long as the seals are not opened. We officers know that.\" He gives you a stern look.",
		"\"You haven't? Why are you bringing up *pale* then?\"",
		"\"You've fried both your brains enough for today, detective...\" He inspects her. No response.",
		"\"Nothing. I just don't think she's connected to anything.\"",
		"\"I don't understand why you're so set on what seems like a... *personal side-task*, but if you must, then let's get it over with...\"",
		"\"That is *exactly* what I didn't want you to do...\" He sighs and turns to the woman. \"Ma'am, my partner wanted to know if you work in pale transport.\"",
		"\"I think we're done here, no?\" He closes his notebook to stress it.",
		"\"You've fried both your brains enough for today, detective...\" He inspects her. No response.",
		"\"I feel like there's still a *long way* to go.\"",
		"\"Because the problem isn't time, it's *you*, detective...\"",
		"\"If you want her attention you may need to be more forceful.\"",
		"The lieutenant considers the slumped form for a moment. He sighs.",
		"\"Great.\" The lieutenant concedes with a head shake. \"He asked the Pines rep about the pale -- and now he's talking to everyone about it...\"",
		"\"Fine.\" He's not buying it. \"Just try not to black out again. And don't *contemplate*. We don't have time for that.\"",
		"\"*Exactly* what I didn't want you to do...\" He sighs and turns to the woman. \"Ma'am, my partner wanted to know if you work in pale transport.\"",
		"\"If you're serious about this, really truly serious, then I suggest you take a long, hard look in the mirror and ask yourself what's *really* going on...\"",
		"\"Great.\" The lieutenant concedes with a head shake. \"He's figured out the pale. And now he's talking to everyone about it...\"",
		"\"You've been saying that for a while. And yet, we only seem to be getting *further* from our actual goal...\"",
		"\"Why? I just told you why.\"",
		"He takes a quick note. \"I could have told you that from just looking at them. Her size is 37.\"",
		"\"In this yard?\" The lieutenant looks at the small building. A flock of grey swallows takes off in the distance.",
		"\"Yes -- and you picked it up as part of the Jamrock shuffle.\" He gives you a weary smile.",
		"\"A black bloc, a part of the city left unrenovated after the war. Or one that has fallen to gang violence. Or has become inhospitable in some other way.\"",
		"\"We should move. I don't think we will solve the murder with forays into the urban hinterland. At least in this phase of the investigation.\"",
		"\"Yes -- for you to pick up as part of the Jamrock shuffle.\" He gives you a weary smile.",
		"\"Someone thought they could have a summer house in a *bloc obscur*. For cheap. It didn't work out. They abandoned it about a decade ago.\"",
		"\"Practically. It's not an official term in any way, but...\" he spreads his arms, \"look around -- no sewage, broken power lines, crime, drunks... Life is tough in the blocs. It's no place to build a summer house.\"",
		"\"We should move. I don't think our suspect is in this particular yard. No place to hide, and besides, it's too close to Martinaise.\"",
		"\"Self pity is not what we need at this moment, officer.\"",
		"\"Sarcastic self pity is not what we need at this moment, officer.\"",
		"\"Huh?\"",
		"\"I understand the situation looks grim, but we must continue with our investigation.\"",
		"\"I should have seen it,\" the lieutenant says with regret. \"The people in the village are going to move out on their own accord sooner or later.\"",
		"\"Yes...\" He reluctantly nods. \"It's probably the smart choice.\"",
		"\"I am not sure whether working with Evrart is particularly ethical either... But I understand and respect your position.\" He looks off to the side, deep in thought.",
		"\"I should have seen it.\" The lieutenant frowns as he reads over the document again.",
		"\"Of course... I should have seen it.\" The lieutenant frowns as he reads over the document again.",
		"\"Hmmmm,\" the lieutenant hums, watching you examine the document again.",
		"\"However... We'll need access to the coast before we do anything. Evrart won't believe you got villagers' signatures if you can't even get to the village.\" He shrugs. \"You can try a forgery as soon as we can cross the water lock.\"",
		"\"We'll need to find you a new weapon -- and we'll need to hope to finish the case without Evrart's help.\" He sighs.",
		"\"Good. Evrart will have to start over with his scheming.\" The lieutenant nods. \"When Isobel disputes her signature the document will be rendered null and void.\"",
		"\"I am not sure whether working with Evrart is particularly ethical either... But I understand and respect your position.\" He looks off to the side, deep in thought.",
		"\"Good. Evrart will have to start over with his scheming.\" The lieutenant nods. \"When she denies that this is her signature the document will be rendered null and void.\"",
		"He nods approvingly. \"Not a decision I would normally condone, but, under the circumstances...\"",
		"\"Any halfway competent notary should be able to handle this. *Not* getting her signature was probably the best thing to do.\"",
		"\"Now all we have to do is mail these. I think I saw a mailbox on the plaza.\"",
		"\"Yes -- being an *asshole* makes this much easier. Let's go.\"",
		"He purses his lips. \"Forgery, yes. It would render the document invalid.\"",
		"\"You probably don't have a pen.\" He takes one out of his pocket. \"Here, you can keep this. I have another one.\"",
		"\"Evrart probably has eyes on us, but...\" He pauses to think. \"If the second signature were to be somehow *wrong*...\"",
		"The lieutenant gives you a long look before speaking. \"For what it's worth, I think you're doing the right thing. Firearms can be replaced. People not so much.\"",
		"\"Let's go get it then.\"",
		"\"This isn't going to work,\" the lieutenant says, looking over your shoulder. \"It doesn't even look like a name. Just a scratch mark.\"",
		"\"Yes.\" The lieutenant nods. \"Too bad we can't see Evrart's face when he finds out.\"",
		"\"Now all we have to do is mail these. I think I saw a mailbox on the plaza.\"",
		"\"Any halfway competent notary should be able to handle this. *Not* getting Isobel's actual signature was probably the best thing to do.\"",
		"\"You made the right choice.\" The lieutenant smiles approvingly. \"Now let's move out and solve this case.\"",
		"\"Good. Evrart will have to start over with his scheming.\" The lieutenant nods. \"When Isobel and Lilienne dispute the signatures the document will be rendered null and void.\"",
		"\"No, it's just a little line. Let's get an actual signature on top of it and it'll be fine.\"",
		"\"Any halfway competent notary should be able to handle this. *Not* getting their actual signatures was probably the best thing to do.\"",
		"\"I should have seen it.\" He frowns as he reads over the document again. \"People will move away on their own accord. Yes, I suppose change always has a price.\"",
		"\"I'm no property lawyer, but it looks fine,\" the lieutenant replies, flipping through the documents. \"I like the print size. They're not selling or leasing anything. It's not a perfect solution, but...\" He shrugs.",
		"\"No, it's just a little line. Let's get an actual signature on top of it and it'll be fine.\"",
		"He nods. \"Not the sort of act I would normally condone, but, under the circumstances, if done *discreetly*... it may be the only way to save what's left of the village.\"",
		"\"It's not the sort of act I would normally encourage, but, under the circumstances, if done *discreetly*... it may be the only way to save what's left of the village.\"",
		"\"All we can do now is *not* mail these to Evrart's accountant.\" He pauses. \"Your gun would probably stay missing though.\"",
		"\"Of course... I should have seen it.\" He frowns as he reads over the document again. \"People will move away on their own accord. I'm not sure they should...\"",
		"\"Evrart probably has eyes on us, but...\" He pauses to think. \"We could try to get other people to sign this instead of those listed. *Or* you could forge their signatures yourself. By the time he finds out, we'll already be gone.\"",
		"\"Yes.\" The lieutenant nods. \"Too bad we won't see Evrart's face when he finds out.\"",
		"\"Congratulations -- that's the gauntlets down, then. We're doing good on the armour collection front.\"",
		"\"The little castle?\" The lieutenant smiles a little. \"The reigning lord must have come upon some really tough times to let it slip in such decrepitude.\"",
		"\"Huh?\" The lieutenant studies the swaying firearm. \"My god, I think you're right.\"",
		"\"Looks like a bad case.\" He gives the woman a compassionate look. \"But the question is what to do with her right now.\"",
		"\"You're right,\" the lieutenant agrees. \"Let's call her out on this.\"",
		"\"I guess I'll just notify my station. They'll contact the Sanitarium and handle the logistics.\"",
		"\"God...\" the lieutenant exhales loudly and uses his off-hand to wipe his forehead. \"I almost blew her head off...\"",
		"\"Phew...\" The lieutenant exhales sharply. \"For a moment there...\"",
		"\"There's a bit more to this than that,\" the lieutenant disagrees. \"But right now we need to decide what to do with her.\"",
		"\"Poor woman...\" The lieutenant holsters his pistol.  \"We need to figure out what to do with her now.\"",
		"\"Could be,\" agrees the lieutenant. \"Her hands were trembling and she did seem uncoordinated... But what are we gonna do with her?\"",
		"\"Then we can ask him once we get back to the Whirling. But we have to hurry, cause it's late and they might have already gone home.\"",
		"Weapon still trained on The Pigs, the lieutenant swiftly reaches down to snatch up the gun.",
		"\"Okay,\" he nods. \"That settles it. I'll contact my station after we wrap it up for the day. They can contact the Sanitarium and handle the logistics.\"",
		"\"I've had... disturbances similar to this before. Many calls, but... never this bad.\"",
		"\"I don't think she actually...\" The lieutenant shakes his head. \"You're right of course. This could've been very bad.\"",
		"\"She's in a stupor,\" the lieutenant replies, inspecting the catatonic woman standing in the dark. \"I've seen this before. God knows for how long... Could be days when they get like this.\"",
		"\"We could let Titus know. This is a perfect problem for the local 'peacekeepers' to handle. They might even know her family.\"",
		"\"I've been thinking that too. But it's impossible to tell for certain in these lighting conditions.\"",
		"\"That would just be a waste of paper. I mean look at her.\" His eyes travel back to the old woman. \"She's not going to respond to a station slip.\"",
		"\"Okay but...\" He bites his lip and mumbles under his breath: \"... probably couldn't change your mind anyway... Let's go then.\"",
		"\"Probably not,\" the lieutenant agrees. \"But more pressing is the question of what to do with her right now?\"",
		"\"Honestly, I don't know. Dementia, probably,\" he lowers his voice. \"Dementia and Channel 8. And loneliness.\"",
		"\"Of course. Understandably things got a bit hectic before. Don't worry about it.\" He smiles as he hands you the weapon. \"Reunited at last. Let's go now.\"",
		"\"But I think we're done here for now. Let's head out, this is done.\"",
		"\"Situation is under control!\" The lieutenant's voice rings over the police siren. \"You're not shot, she's not a threat, everybody stay calm!\"",
		"\"I don't think there's any need for that. In her current state -- and without the gun -- she isn't really a threat to anyone.\"",
		"\"No,\" the lieutenant sharply interjects. \"That is not an option. We'll either unload this to Titus and his guys or I'll ask for help from my station.\"",
		"\"Oh, before we go...\" The lieutenant pulls out your service pistol. \"I believe this belongs to you.\"",
		"\"And, I mean... it would be one twist too many if it turned out these two old men were our killers. That's just unlikely. No...\" He seems pleased with himself. \"We would only have wasted our time here.\"",
		"\"They didn't,\" the lieutenant calms you. \"Trust me. I saw the bodies.\"",
		"\"Don't beat yourself up about it. I think I gave you a pretty exhaustive answer about those flowers and what they mean.\"",
		"\"You mean the guys who were playing pétanque?\"",
		"\"Have you noticed people sometimes appear and disappear in places? It's called *doing things*.\"",
		"\"You'll get them next time,\" the lieutenant replies, looking at the empty crater.",
		"\"Hey -- let's keep moving, detective.\" The lieutenant adjusts his glasses.",
		"\"Looks like it.\"",
		"\"Not as such, no. Let's keep moving, detective.\"",
		"Lieutenant Kitsuragi's stern expression remains unchanged -- but you sense he can't be happy about this turn of events.",
		"Lieutenant Kitsuragi's stern expression remains unchanged -- but you sense something there. Below...",
		"The lieutenant turns and gives you a barely perceptible nod.",
		"\"Every school of thought and government has failed in this city -- but I love it nonetheless. It belongs to me as much as it belongs to you.\"",
		"\"Let's just go and ask Tommy, alright? We're wasting our time here.\"",
		"\"A small 'Tempo' by the monument, green...\" He turns to you. \"Let's get into that lorry.\"",
		"\"You really got him there, detective.\"",
		"The lieutenant looks at you sceptically but does not object.",
		"The lieutenant gives you a brief, sideways glance.",
		"\"Okay, that's enough, detective. That's enough.\"",
		"The lieutenant tries to remain impassive but the slight arch of his eyebrow tells you that he's liking it.",
		"\"It's not a hard job. It won't take a long time. It won't make Padre Madre *angry*.\" He looks at him. \"But a stupid fucking racist is standing in the way, *protecting* this fucking thief...\"",
		"\"Do continue, *sir*.\" The lieutenant steps up to him again, his frame tense as a coiled spring.",
		"\"I know exactly what you meant. You think my *kind* doesn't belong here. That I should *watch myself* and *behave*.\"",
		"\"Yes, yes. *Where* is he?\"",
		"\"You've seen that corpse in the ceramic armour there?\" The lieutenant points to the yard. \"Did his shitty little guild protect *him*?\"",
		"\"*When* did she go away?\"",
		"It doesn't look like the lieutenant cares. He just makes a little note.",
		"\"We'll just have to ask someone else about the lady driver. Let's go.\"",
		"\"But you see, I'm an officer of the RCM -- it's actually *my* job to make sure *you* behave. I would advise you to remember that.\"",
		"\"No.\" The lieutenant turns to the lorryman. \"He means *La Puta Madre*.\"",
		"\"No. Of course not. *We're* not peones. But *if* we were... and one of Madre's drivers were to be stealing from him -- then it's a good peone's job to find out who that is.\"",
		"The lieutenant raises one eyebrow. \"You've seen the corpse in the yard, yes? You took a peek. I *know* you did. Does it look like his friends protected *him*?\"",
		"\"So you're telling us that you don't know *anything* about drug smuggling through Terminal B?\"",
		"\"Technically, you're *stomping* on Revachol every step you take.\"",
		"\"Then I presume you're familiar with his *peones*?\"",
		"\"It's men like you who keep Revachol divided, making it that much harder for everyone to climb out of this post-war limbo.\"",
		"\"Don't you *Welcome to Revachol* me,\" the lieutenant fires back. \"My grandfather came here from a three-thousand-year-old racist-isolationist culture, while your ancestors came to this island a mere three hundred years ago.\"",
		"\"I wouldn't be so sure about it -- not until we've heard what Siileng himself has to say.\"",
		"The lieutenant exhales and resumes his regular calmness.",
		"\"Not just the unions. He has peones *everywhere*. Some say he even has them in the RCM.\" He gets closer to him. \"Dirty fucking peones who'd do *anything* for him. Multi-ethnic drug addicts...\"",
		"The lieutenant looks at you. \"How do you want to proceed?\"",
		"He pays you no attention. \"It's men like you who keep Revachol divided, making it that much harder for everyone to climb out of this post-war limbo.\"",
		"The lieutenant turns to the lorryman. \"You mean *La Puta Madre*.\"",
		"\"He means the people living in Graad.\"",
		"\"Ice bear fridge?\"",
		"\"Crime is what we were solving before this conversation began.\"",
		"\"Yes, people get that you are *the law*. You really don't have to keep saying it.\"",
		"\"It does not *manifest* itself in any way. It does not exist.\"",
		"The lieutenant does not flinch at the comment. He does not flinch even a single bit. He is intensely not flinching. It takes effort.",
		"\"Crime is a deviation from the law punishable by either a civil or criminal sentencing. It's what *The Law* prevents.\"",
		"The lieutenant slowly -- ever so slowly -- realizes something. \"Party eyes. Yes, of course. That makes sense.\"",
		"\"Everyone understands you're *the law*. That's why you have that insignia on your arm. So you don't have to keep saying it.\"",
		"\"It does not *manifest* itself in any way. It does not exist. I liked it better when we were talking about whether it's appropriate to stand out in the freezing weather.\"",
		"\"No such thing.\" The lieutenant stands at your side, stern and serious.",
		"\"That's very good to hear.\" She flicks you a thumbs up. \"You'll get to the bottom of this in no time! Just like a detective in the stories.\"",
		"\"We can go into the bookstore and ask about the case, but I don't see much more to look *into* here.\" The lieutenant makes a note in his notebook.",
		"\"Wonderful.\"",
		"The lieutenant stands by -- looking at the two of you with little interest.",
		"\"Racist-nationalist paraphernalia.\" He grits his teeth. \"Not unusual in this part of town.\"",
		"\"Racist-nationalist paraphernalia.\" He grits his teeth. \"Not unusual in this part of town. This is our guy.\" The lieutenant nods towards the racist lorry driver.",
		"\"Likely, yes. This guy's proud of who he is. Drapes it all over his machine.\"",
		"\"And one more thing -- as you've seen, these sorts of attitudes are quite common in Martinaise. So I expect this to happen again. And again...\"",
		"The lieutenant falls silent and looks down at his boots. Whether he thinks you have a point or not, he isn't saying. It's unclear what this means for your relationship. Then he speaks...",
		"\"Wonderful.\" The lieutenant falls silent. His expression is hard to read, but it certainly doesn't look *happy*. Then he speaks...",
		"\"And what exactly do you think should happen to those with *undesirable* traits?\"",
		"\"I've had this conversation enough times in my life. From now on, I'm going to stay out of it. How you choose to respond is your business.\" He concludes: \"Now -- let's get back to the task at hand.\"",
		"\"Apology accepted, detective.\" The lieutenant relaxes. A weight seems to have been lifted from his shoulders.",
		"\"I'm going to *stop* this conversation.\" He makes a sudden hand gesture. An open palm. \"This is Martinaise. People have certain attitudes here. You will find plenty of citizens to agree with you. As for me...\"",
		"\"That's good to hear. I don't want there to be any unnecessary friction in our relationship during this *important* case.\"",
		"\"I don't know what you mean by *death's head* but it certainly looks like you're becoming a racist, officer.\"",
		"\"And what point would that be?\"",
		"\"Our position in Revachol is already precarious: Many people think we're vigilantes as it is. I can't have them thinking we're *racist* vigilantes to boot.\"",
		"\"Well,\" he says after taking a moment to collect himself. \"You've made your views on the subject quite clear...\" Another little pause.",
		"\"Stop right there. I know what you're going to say. Don't. Also -- these attitudes are quite common in Martinaise. So I expect this to happen again. And again.\"",
		"The lieutenant narrows his gaze. \"So you *don't* find his views... say, *unbefitting of a police officer*?\"",
		"The lieutenant looks at you in silence, though you cannot discern if he's judging you or not. \"I suppose your reasons are your own.\"",
		"\"There are tens of thousands of people who grew up in Martinaise and somehow managed to avoid becoming racists who yell 'Come here, saffron picker' at passers by.\"",
		"\"I suppose that's a relief. Just be careful how often you avail yourself of this 'technique'. A lie may be useful in the short-term, but they have a way of catching up with you later.\"",
		"The lieutenant says nothing, waiting for you to continue.",
		"\"I've had this conversation enough times in my life. From now on, I'm  going to stay out of it. How you choose to respond is your business.\" He concludes: \"But be careful. Now, let's move on.\"",
		"\"Let me say just one more thing. As you've seen, these sorts of attitudes are quite common in Martinaise. So I expect this to happen again. And again...\"",
		"\"There's a difference between saying something crude -- and an ideological racist.\"",
		"The lieutenant takes a step back and looks at the church looming overhead. \"Yes, there's a toolbox in the Kineema...\"",
		"\"How about we go and check out that tent again?\" He nods at the shabby piece of canvas set up on the ice next to the church.",
		"\"No.\"",
		"\"Let's go.\" The lieutenant nods at you.",
		"\"Can you hear the pulsing bass underneath the wind?\" He raises his hand to his ear. \"A sure sign of junior delinquency -- somewhere east of here.\"",
		"\"Besides, we should really get to the island.\" He looks at the sea.",
		"\"It does seem rather irrelevant to our case.\" The lieutenant nods.",
		"\"I don't know... you *don't*? Or maybe we'll find a new one. I don't carry more than one prybar with me...\" He looks up at the bell-tower.",
		"\"But maybe we should look for another way in first... The building has seen enough mistreatment.\"",
		"He takes a step back. \"Maybe we should circle the building first and look for another way. The building has seen enough mistreatment.\"",
		"\"Can you hear the pulsing bass underneath the east wind?\" He raises his hand to his ear. \"A sure sign of junior delinquency.\"",
		"The lieutenant looks at the padlock. He didn't hear you asking, you were quiet enough.",
		"\"These acts aren't called *crimes* as they would be for adults. Crimes committed by minors are called 'delinquent acts'. This was part of your officer's exams.\" He puts the handkerchief in his coat pocket.",
		"\"For Revachol ZoC, the Moralintern defines junior delinquents as minors between the ages of 10 and 16 who have committed an act in violation of the law...\"",
		"He takes off his glasses and uses a blue handkerchief to thoroughly wipe them clean before inspecting the sticker. Then he looks up, pauses, and replies...",
		"\"If you really think we should get in there, we need to find some other way...\"",
		"\"I thought this was a lousy way to enter a place of worship that's already in disrepair. I guess the church agreed.\"",
		"\"I haven't seen that sticker before. And I am not a youth.\"",
		"\"Do you think our suspect is hiding inside?\" He raises his sight to the darkened windows overhead.",
		"The lieutenant hands you a blue handkerchief. He looks a little dismayed when he gets it back crumpled. However, it should be easier to peel the sticker off now.",
		"\"I'm not as *sturdy* as you are. I have even less leverage.\" He doesn't even try to sound convincing.",
		"\"Looks like a dead man smiling. Suggests... junior delinquency.\"",
		"He takes a step back. \"Maybe we should look for another way in first... The church has seen enough mistreatment.\"",
		"\"People do look to churches for shelter, but an abandoned thing like this... I'm not so sure.\"",
		"The lieutenant nods silently.",
		"That hurt. The lieutenant looks up at the roof of the church, ignoring your little tantrum.",
		"\"Tools break, officer. Try to control yourself.\"",
		"\"But maybe we should circle the building and look for another way in first. The building has seen enough mistreatment.\"",
		"\"I don't think that's going to work...\"",
		"\"That level of conceptual thinking is not part of my skill set.\"",
		"\"You go ahead, I'm too old for this...\"",
		"\"I'm sure you will feel right at home. I'll keep watch.\" He gestures for you to squeeze in.",
		"\"Oh no.\" The lieutenant closes his eyes. \"We're going to be in this church *forever*.\"",
		"The lieutenant isn't saying anything -- he's watching you, observing.",
		"\"Of course, he had to smuggle in 'furies' somehow...\" the lieutenant mumbles to himself.",
		"\"No, detective. It is not.\" The lieutenant looks toward the church door. \"We really should get to the Whirling-in-Rags. Now.\"",
		"\"I wouldn't. I wouldn't build a club and I wouldn't name it either.\"",
		"He sighs, then adds in a resigned tone: \"If you must.\"",
		"\"I suppose we'll have to pass by it again at some point anyway,\" he says in a tone of resignation.",
		"\"Mhm, sure.\" The lieutenant looks up at the wall reluctantly, then back at you.",
		"The lieutenant sighs. \"Why must we stop to look at this wall every time we pass by? We have business to attend to.\"",
		"\"Huh?\"",
		"\"A saying. Up on Marvel Hill -- a great, high place. One that is impossible to climb back to.\"",
		"\"No...\" He thinks for a moment. \"But isn't that an expression, not a place?\"",
		"\"No offence, detective, but you're not particularly *subtle*.\"",
		"\"Still smelling for communists, detective?\"",
		"\"You're smelling for...\"",
		"\"Well, I'll be over here when you've finished.\" The lieutenant nudges something on the ground with his foot.",
		"\"You're developing your...\"",
		"\"There's a lot to take in, isn't there?\" The lieutenant wrinkles his nose.",
		"\"Everything in order, detective?\" The lieutenant gives you a quizzical look.",
		"\"You know what? I'll just leave you to it. Carry on, detective.\"",
		"\"I'm struggling to see the connection with our investigation, but I'm sure *all will be revealed* in time.\"",
		"\"A *personal errand*.\"",
		"\"In the interest of our investigation, I suggest you focus on the case at hand. You can pursue your *political projects* after hours.\"",
		"\"Uh huh.\"",
		"\"Let's go, detective. We'll get nowhere standing around in the snow.\" The lieutenant brushes a few scales of snow off his jacket.",
		"\"Something's not right here. The equation doesn't quite balance...\" He taps his foot and takes a deep breath.",
		"\"Well, detective. It seems we've located your underground cell...\" He looks over the balcony, down toward the water.",
		"You notice the lieutenant is looking uncustomarily anxious. His posture is rigid, his right hand hovers near the zipper of his jacket.",
		"\"Oh, I'm fine. I was practically *born* to infiltrate underground communist cells...\" He takes a quick look over his shoulder.",
		"\"Let's go, detective. We'll get nowhere standing around in the rain.\" The lieutenant wipes back a wet lock of hair.",
		"\"*Charmant*. After you, detective.\"",
		"\"Which is just to say: We should be prepared for *any* eventuality.\"",
		"\"Let's go, detective. We'll get nowhere standing around here in the dark.\" The moonlight reflects white in the lieutenant's glasses.",
		"\"A great question.\"",
		"\"These things happen with him sometimes. I recommend a change of subject.\"",
		"... even the lieutenant seems engrossed, despite your revealing details of an RCM investigation...",
		"The lieutenant says nothing, but a bemused grin crosses his face.",
		"\"No doubt.\"",
		"\"Good god, detective! What's wrong with you?\"",
		"\"To be clear: Communism is not an official suspect in this investigation. Because it's not a *person*, you see.\"",
		"\"Yes, and it only took about four hours of our lives that we'll never get back.\"",
		"The lieutenant looks at you, then at the young man. He seems to be giving your question serious consideration.",
		"... even the lieutenant seems engrossed, despite your revealing details of an RCM investigation...",
		"\"I can't recall the exact explanation, but it has something to do with the kinetic energy stored in the elbow. Basically, you're less able to control a *backhanded* slap, and therefore more likely to cause serious injury.\"",
		"Another quarter of an hour disappears. The conversation bounces back and forth. Whatever their pretensions, it's clear these two have been craving something *real*.",
		"\"Easy, detective. No need to treat this kid like he's some Son of Measurehead.\"",
		"\"Speaking as an officer of the RCM, it is an *extremely* bad idea to strike a civilian without cause...\"",
		"Even the lieutenant is watching intently now.",
		"\"This is impossible, right? There's no way it's really staying up like that...\"",
		"\"No, detective. The only reading I've been doing is right here...\" The lieutenant holds up his little blue notebook.",
		"\"I have not had time to seek out pretentious communist book clubs, nor have I done their 'reading'.\"",
		"\"Or even death, if, say, you happen to be wearing a set of armoured ceramic gauntlets.\"",
		"\"Again, he was just a regular high-net-worth individual. There was nothing *extra-physical* about him...\"",
		"\"Repressed sexualities are something of an *idée fixe* of his.\"",
		"\"In all fairness, the whole situation is rather complicated.\"",
		"\"Either that, or an *extremely* convincing act...\"",
		"\"You see, that attitude is precisely why the field manual's guidance is so valuable...\"",
		"\"There's no *what if*, because I won't. This is your thing, remember?\"",
		"The lieutenant nods.",
		"\"That doesn't sound so bad,\" the lieutenant says. \"In any case, it's healthier than certain *other* after-hours pursuits I've seen officers engage in.\" He gives you a pointed look.",
		"\"The work he did on the autopsy was quite good, I can confirm.\"",
		"\"Good god, have we really been talking about 'unpeeling time' for a quarter hour?\"",
		"\"Not the best look for the RCM, but I suppose it could've gone worse.\"",
		"\"Hmm. What is it they say about ties? That they're like kissing your sister... or in this case, I suppose, your partner.\"",
		"\"In any case, a change of subject might help.\"",
		"\"It advises officers in physical altercations to rely on the open-palm strike, as opposed to the backhand, in non-lethal situations.\"",
		"\"My partner, of course, is acting in a strictly *personal capacity*, not as an official representative of the RCM.\"",
		"\"He's only saying that because he got the better of me, somehow...\"",
		"\"It seems he's lost his words. A case of momentary aphasia, it looks like...\" The lieutenant does not appear overly concerned.",
		"\"However, if one were to strike a civilian, which again I would never recommend, one should at least follow the RCM manual's guidance on non-lethal strikes.\"",
		"\"Yes, the problem is almost certainly your *lack of commitment*, and not, say, gravity.\"",
		"The lieutenant sighs. \"Something tells me these young men are not very experienced with law enforcement.\"",
		"\"Everything in order, detective?\" The lieutenant gives you a concerned look.",
		"\"Ah, so we're beating the youth now? That's an unexpected development.\"",
		"\"At the same time, this is emphatically *your thing*, so do as you will.\"",
		"\"Yes, only the detective here would draw a connection between a made-up division of para-psychics and the addled ramblings of a defunct communist mage...\"",
		"The lieutenant doesn't speak, but you believe you detect a slight widening of his eyes, as though he never expected such a cogent thought to emerge from your mouth.",
		"\"That's a 'yes,' I take it? Can you give me an affirmative?\"",
		"\"As in, 'No, everything is *not* in order'? Can you give me a negative, detective?\"",
		"\"Detective, how should *I* know what questions *you* have about communism?\"",
		"\"I'll sit this one out. I don't think you want my *skeptical materialism* interfering...\"",
		"The lieutenant says nothing, but his expression suggests otherwise.",
		"\"He's only saying that because he *likes* getting thrashed like a schoolboy.\"",
		"\"I had no idea its origins went all the way back to the Revolution itself. But it makes sense, in a way...\"",
		"\"Kim and *I*...\" the lieutenant mutters under his breath. He scribbles something in his notebook but adds nothing else.",
		"\"Well, I think we're probably finished here, detective.\"",
		"\"Not pretty. Eventually the force of gravity would have caused the rest of the body to separate from the head. There would have been *very little* for us to work with...\"",
		"\"Oh, it's a great story. You should check out Nilsen's journals if you ever have the chance.\"",
		"\"...\"",
		"\"They’re not primary school delinquents, they’re university students. Attendance isn't compulsory. Besides, we’re not the skip squad.\"",
		"\"Wow, a *real* intellectual, it sounds like.\" The lieutenant arches his eyebrows.",
		"\"Speaking frankly, it's a terrible idea. The RCM already has issues with *wanton brutality* and this is unlikely to ameliorate those concerns...\"",
		"\"What are you talking about, detective? You can't give up *now*.\"",
		"\"Yes, I'm rather curious myself.\"",
		"\"Perhaps, but it's a fantasy that *pays* for things, like your hostel bill...\"",
		"\"...\"",
		"\"Ah, we're replaying *this* little episode. Please, do try to stay on your feet this time.\"",
		"\"This has certainly turned out to be a punchier case than I had anticipated.\"",
		"\"Ah, so we're beating *another* youth only tangentially connected to the case. Spectacular.\"",
		"\"Thank god we avoided *that* fiasco, at least...\"",
		"\"You're developing your...\"",
		"\"There's a lot to take in, isn't there?\" The lieutenant wrinkles his nose.",
		"\"You know what? I'll just leave you to it. Carry on, detective.\"",
		"\"Still smelling for communists, detective?\"",
		"\"I'm struggling to see the connection with our investigation, but I'm sure *all will be revealed* in time.\"",
		"\"Everything in order, detective?\" The lieutenant gives you a quizzical look.",
		"\"A personal errand.\"",
		"\"Well, I'll be over here when you've finished.\" The lieutenant nudges a piece of trash with his foot.",
		"\"You do remember that we're investigating a *murder*, yes? I would appreciate it if you reserved your political projects for after-hours.\"",
		"\"Uh huh.\"",
		"\"No offence, detective, but you're not particularly *subtle*.\"",
		"\"You're smelling for...\"",
		"\"Well, there you have it. No reason to get hung up on the pretentious ramblings of a few young men.\"",
		"\"You know, not too long ago I listened to a *fascinating radio programme* on traditional Samaran folk dances. The costumes they wear are supposed to be extraordinary...\"",
		"\"They're quite the spectacle, as I understand. I've heard they make the people in the front rows wear plastic sheets...\"",
		"\"Oh, come on. Can this article read your mind?\"",
		"\"I'm sure most things are, if the young men who wrote this article are to be believed.\"",
		"\"You know, *most* people would just write a letter to the editor...\"",
		"\"On account of the blood, you see.\"",
		"The lieutenant sighs. \"A certain kind of young man reads one or two books and suddenly thinks he understands the secret structures of reality...\"",
		"\"What you do in your spare time is your business. In the meantime, I would prefer you focus on our case.\"",
		"\"I can safely say the thought had never crossed my mind, detective.\" The lieutenant furrows his brow.",
		"\"I can imagine. Something tells me there's not exactly a glut of young communists itching to write about TipTop for *La Fumée*...\"",
		"\"I suppose that *would* be something to see.\" The lieutenant seems amused at the thought of you wrestling a bear.",
		"\"You can still like it, detective. Just because a couple of fools wrote an article doesn't mean it's true.\"",
		"\"If I had to wager, I'd say they've never even *seen* the inside of a motor, much less a motor race. I'd take whatever they write with a large grain of salt.\"",
		"\"Or even better,\" he stops to correct himself, \"just leave it be.\"",
		"\"What do you expect? It was laying around the office of the Débardeurs' Union. They're probably *bankrolling* the thing.\"",
		"\"The Samaran People's Republic?\" The lieutenant frowns. \"No, I should expect not. Why do you ask?\"",
		"\"In any event, no, I haven't seen any evidence there's a *Samaran angle* to this case.\"",
		"\"That happened exactly once, and only under extreme duress.\"",
		"\"Did I? My bad, detective. Won't happen again.\" He doesn't look up from his notebook.",
		"The lieutenant remains engrossed in his notebook.",
		"\"I would say we share a perfectly average connection for two law officials working a case.\"",
		"Your words hang in the air as the lieutenant scribbles something in his notebook. At some point he realizes you're waiting for him and looks up with a tightly knit brow.",
		"\"My apologies, I thought leaving your partner hanging was simply the style at the 41st.\"",
		"\"I suppose we do work quite well together.\"",
		"\"We have never shared a sandwich, detective. Despite your heroic efforts, I might add.\"",
		"\"It's true that you and I do share a similar addiction, but that's hardly remarkable among officers of the RCM.\"",
		"The lieutenant looks at you evenly for a moment, then returns to his notebook without a word.",
		"\"If by 'special' you mean 'marred by extreme dysfunction,' then yes, I suppose it is pretty special.\"",
		"\"What I'm trying to say, is that in your own twisted way, you're *almost a genius*, a genius who's dedicated his entire malignant existence to devising new and spectacular ways to be *wrong*.\"",
		"\"... someone has been maintaining it...\"",
		"\"It's just a little bit of pale interference, detective. A little *eerie*, perhaps, but perfectly explicable...\"",
		"\"... a long winter... Long and cold...\"",
		"\"Afraid of what, detective?\"",
		"The lieutenant takes a moment to compose his thoughts...",
		"The lieutenant slowly removes his headset and turns to you.",
		"\"It's cold now...\"",
		"\"Yes, you're a natural gymnast, detective. Now would you like to do what you got up there to do?\"",
		"\"It's been a long winter... Long and cold.\"",
		"\"...someone has been maintaining it. The wiring has been repaired...\"",
		"\"...someone has been maintaining it. The wiring has been repaired...\"",
		"\"... someone has been maintaining it...\" The lieutenant's voice suddenly grows faint and distant, as though he were speaking from a passing motor carriage...",
		"\"Detective, what in god's name are you doing?\"",
		"\"... a long winter...\"",
		"\"But you see, detective, that feeling is simply an illusion caused by distance. Whether you choose to see it or not, the reality does not change.\"",
		"\"I apologise, detective. I let my emotions get the better of me just now. You can be a fine police officer, but sometimes you, well...\"",
		"\"Everything alright, detective?\"",
		"\"But you made the *right* decision, the more difficult decision, in my mind, at least.\"",
		"\"Yes, I know...\" The lieutenant allows himself a sheepish half-smile. \"In my experience, when you make the wrong decision, you can tell right away. It's the right decisions that won't leave you alone...\"",
		"\"It's been a long winter... Long and cold.\"",
		"The lieutenant adjusts his microphone and slowly looks up toward you.",
		"\"I don't... what are you saying, detective?\"",
		"\"What 'options'? What in god's name are you talking about, detective?\"",
		"\"Yes, I imagine it must be.\"",
		"\"But you *did* accomplish your task. You reached the Coalition. I must admit, I didn't seriously think you could do it, but you've proved me wrong.\"",
		"\"You are currently speaking with Coalition Warship Archer, flagship of INSURCOM forces in Revachol.\"",
		"\"You may feel that way for some time yet. In my experience, when you make the wrong decision, you can tell right away. It's the right decisions that won't leave you alone...\"",
		"\"I don't know your history, detective, but I can say with great certainty that whatever you're running from won't disappear simply because you've abandoned your former life...\"",
		"\"This absolute lunatic! But why am I surprised?\"",
		"\"But that's just how things go. We all must accept our own shortcomings and limitations.\"",
		"\"But I embrace it *because* it's my role, and it's yours too, detective, whether you accept it or not!\"",
		"\"You actually haven't. But you have proven that you're a relatively capable climber.\"",
		"\"But someone has been maintaining it. The wiring has been repaired...\"",
		"\"Now, get down from there. We've got work to do.\"",
		"\"... is how much further you plan to take... *whatever this is*.\"",
		"\"Detective, each of us has our part to play in the world. My part is to solve crimes. I am under no illusion that my role isn't a minor one, in the scheme of things...\"",
		"\"I don't understand. I thought he was making progress...\"",
		"\"Really? I don't think this is the *first* time you've *misspoken* in that way.\"",
		"\"I think it's best for you to climb off the statue now, detective. Your real work is down here.\"",
		"\"It's been a long winter... Long and cold.\"",
		"\"Listen, detective. I want you to consider, at least for a moment, the possibility that *your actual responsibility lies down here*...\"",
		"\"I don't understand. I thought he was making progress...\"",
		"The lieutenant takes a deep breath, appearing to gather even more energy and rage, but when he opens his mouth to continue his fulmination, he just sighs...",
		"\"There is no way *that* is going to make any difference...\"",
		"\"I didn't say anything, detective.\"",
		"\"Sorry, detective. That wasn't entirely justified. You're not *all* bad. It's just that sometimes, you, well...\"",
		"\"There is some truth to that,\" the lieutenant whispers into his headset.",
		"\"Glad that stuff came in handy after all...\"",
		"The lieutenant looks up at you with a nervous glance.",
		"The lieutenant isn't looking at you or at the massive aerostatic hovering less than 20 metres above him. He appears to be concentrating on the braid of cables running from the amplifier.",
		"\"For the last time, detective. You. Did. Not. Commit. The. Murder. Archer, please disregard his nonsense.\"",
		"\"Are you completely out of your mind, detective? Archer, please give us a moment!\"",
		"\"No, you ridiculous fool. You're *not* right. You're not even remotely right.\"",
		"\"...someone has been maintaining it. The wiring has been repaired...\"",
		"The lieutenant takes a moment to compose his thoughts...",
		"The lieutenant takes a moment to compose his thoughts...",
		"\"I suppose I enjoy casework too much. But surely you have more interesting things to discuss with the Coalition than my career path.\"",
		"\"Is this really the time, detective?\"",
		"\"Everything in order, detective? You're really giving Filippe III a stare.\"",
		"\"Listen, I understand that you're disappointed that things did not turn out how you might have hoped...\"",
		"\"Now, come on. We still have a long day ahead of us.\"",
		"\"Well, what now?\"",
		"\"... is when you're going to *drop this farce* and come back to work.\"",
		"\"Because that's what it means to be an officer of the RCM!\"",
		"\"This absolute lunatic! But why am I surprised?\"",
		"\"You really don't know?\"",
		"\"Now, come on. It's getting late.\"",
		"The lieutenant sighs. \"What's *one more trip* across the waterlock?\"",
		"\"Mention what?\"",
		"\"I promise you, I didn't, even though it certainly *sounds* like me...\" The lieutenant seems to wince at the sound of his own voice.",
		"\"I can assure you, it's not my 'twin brother'. Though it certainly does *sound* like me...\" The lieutenant seems to wince at the sound of his own voice.",
		"\"You've accomplished your side task, you've contacted Coalition Warship Archer. I suppose what I'm asking...\"",
		"\"This absolute lunatic! But why am I surprised?\"",
		"\"In fact, if right were a country, you would be deported immediately. You would be *persona non grata* in the Country of Right.\"",
		"\"I don't know where this case will lead us, detective, but in a sense that doesn't matter. Our job is to follow the evidence where it leads, consequences be damned...\"",
		"\"Yes, and then?\"",
		"\"Let me get this straight, detective: You're saying the only 'normal, reasonable' option available to you is to abandon your job and your life so you can fly away on a Moralintern warship?\"",
		"\"Good god, here we go...\"",
		"\"Really? Because I'm not entirely sure that you *do*, detective.\"",
		"\"I'm not kidding, detective. It's time to come down.\"",
		"\"Because I can see you're still agonising over it. In my experience, when you make the wrong decision, you can tell right away. It's the right decisions that won't leave you alone...\"",
		"\"Because the thing you're running from is *inside you*, detective!\"",
		"\"What do you mean?'",
		"\"... It's been a long winter... Long and cold...\"",
		"\"It's been a long winter... Long and cold.\"",
		"\"Detective, what in god's name are you saying? Archer, please disregard that...\"",
		"\"Enough with the apocalyptic drivel! Archer, please disregard, he's not in his right mind.\"",
		"\"Don't you think we should *finish our case* before you go taking on more responsibility?\"",
		"\"I don't understand. I thought he was making progress...\"",
		"\"I suppose that's possible...\"",
		"\"It's as though *right* is over here...\" He holds up one hand. \"... while *you're* over here...\" He holds up his other hand, as far apart from the first as possible.",
		"\"Do you know what the worst part is, detective? The more time I spend with you, the more I feel myself *becoming* like you...\"",
		"The lieutenant sighs. \"What's *one more trip* across the waterlock?\"",
		"\"... is whether we're about to lose you to the Moralintern.\"",
		"\"It's done. I believe we're ready.\" The lieutenant wipes his brow.",
		"\"It's eerie, for certain, but also harmless. I just wish I could remember what I was talking about...\"",
		"A scoff from the lieutenant's channel.",
		"\"Detective, before you answer that, I urge you to weigh your words *extremely* carefully.\"",
		"The lieutenant looks up toward you. He starts to open his mouth, then appears to think better of it.",
		"\"Hmmm. Well, in that case...\"",
		"The lieutenant gives a long sigh as he removes his headphones. He looks up at you.",
		"The lieutenant gives a long sigh as he removes his headphones. There's relief on his face as he turns toward you.",
		"\"But now you've got what you came for, so I suppose we'll have to see this business through.\"",
		"\"Let me make a prediction, detective. You are not going to see the inside of a Coalition warship anytime soon.\"",
		"\"Hmm. I don't think the people who typically buy these machines are very concerned with questions of *style*.\"",
		"\"Show me what, detective?\" The lieutenant seems immensely pleased by your irritation.",
		"\"I suppose it does have a certain 'no-nonsense' appeal, if you prefer that sort of thing.\"",
		"\"It doesn't, frankly. Don't get me wrong, this appears to be a *fine* transceiver for a general audience, but it's not something a serious radio-head would use.\" He shrugs.",
		"\"To be perfectly frank, I have my reservations about this whole antenna scheme. But who knows? We may yet be surprised.\"",
		"\"Of course not, detective. This is *strictly* business.\" The lieutenant smiles to himself.",
		"\"Yes, 'reliable and unassuming' are *definitely* words I'd use to describe you.\"",
		"\"I'm sure the transceiver understands, detective. Now let's go.\"",
		"\"There's usually a little switch somewhere... Ah, yes, it's the one that says 'RELEASE'.\" The lieutenant points to the side of the radio.",
		"\"I wouldn't like to guess. Your performance so far doesn't exactly inspire confidence, but all sorts of things are possible...\"",
		"\"Very good. Let's get going then.\"",
		"\"I certainly understand the impulse, but this is our job, detective. Our whole *raison d'être*. At some point, we'll need to return to it.\"",
		"The lieutenant gives you a brief nod.",
		"\"You've surprised me more than once during the course of our investigation, but I have to say it still seems like a *remote* scenario.\" He shrugs.",
		"\"But here's the thing, detective. *We're* the proper channels. Doing our work, right here on the ground, is how we'll solve this case. There's no need to bring the Coalition into this.\"",
		"\"Who's to say what's possible and what's not?\"",
		"\"I'm more interested in *why* you're so fixated on this idea in the first place.\"",
		"\"You sound pathological, you know that? Now come on, let's stop wasting time.\"",
		"\"What do you need with another transceiver? It's almost exactly like the one you took from that radiocomputer in the Doomed Commercial Area.\"",
		"\"*You* could reach the Coalition and have your talk about *la responsabilité*... *I* could grow 10 centimetres and become a flanker for the Stormers.\"",
		"\"I suppose it will.\" The lieutenant smiles to himself.",
		"\"I'm not sure where you're getting that. It's a perfectly fine transceiver and this is a perfectly ordinary office.\"",
		"\"Now, let's go. You've done enough damage here.\"",
		"\"I must apologise on my partner's behalf, again. Please believe me when I say that he does not speak for the RCM in *any* capacity.\"",
		"\"Hmmm, perhaps your young friends in the *tent* might be of assistance?\"",
		"\"Mr. Villedrouin...\" The lieutenant nods.",
		"\"Good god, couldn't you *try* at least?\"",
		"\"I'm not even sure why I'm bothering. This is *your* side task, after all...\"",
		"\"Yes, I was wondering the same thing. What are you doing?\"",
		"\"I don't understand why you have it in for this man. He's never been anything but gracious and helpful to our cause. Why do you feel the need to insult him?\"",
		"\"Of course he does, he's from the Moralintern. But that doesn't mean *we* don't have standards to maintain...\"",
		"\"Good god, couldn't you *pretend* at least?\"",
		"\"Oh, good: 'Techno-tinkerers.' Just what this *side task* was missing...\"",
		"The lieutenant stares at the man's back, then steps away. He makes sure no one else can hear him as he turns to face you...",
		"\"Hmmm, sounds like something that programmer we met in the church might be able to help with...\"",
		"\"Never mind. Another question -- was it all worth it?\"",
		"\"Okay.\" The lieutenant snaps shut like a lily in the afternoon.",
		"He nods in hopes of humouring you then closes his eyes for half a beat. When he opens them, it's clear he has something to say to you...",
		"\"About this... pursuit of wealth... pursuit of recognition.\" He looks up, trying to find a name for your actions.",
		"\"Tax? What tax? We're in Revachol.\" He looks around, as if looking for hidden taxation, then shakes his head.",
		"\"I don't think we have time for that. And even if we did, I doubt he's around anymore. Everyone's left.\"",
		"\"Why did you do it?\"",
		"\"And was it all worth it?\"",
		"He nods. The roundabout is quiet, almost eerily so under the brilliant sunlight. The tickets remain true to their duty -- except for a few that have come unstuck, now assigned to brushing dirt from the asphalt below...",
		"He nods. The roundabout is quiet, almost eerily so under the brilliant sunlight. The penumbral griever is a silhouette against the bright sky, the flowers lifting him in requiem starting to wilt...",
		"\"You managed to gather quite a fortune, kicked off by underpaying a young artist...\"",
		"\"Ah yes. Spoken like a true businessman.\" He smiles gently.",
		"\"I don't think we have time for that. And even if we did, I doubt he's around anymore. Everyone's left.\"",
		"\"And was it all worth it?\"",
		"He nods. The roundabout is quiet, almost eerily so under the brilliant sunlight. The tickets remain true to their duty -- except for a few that have come unstuck, now assigned to brushing dirt from the asphalt below...",
		"\"Alright, shall we? We still have some things left to do before we can go home.\"",
		"\"Who?\" The lieutenant meets your eyes with a questioning glance -- then looks up again.",
		"\"A fitting testament to the lives lost,\" the lieutenant says as he turns toward the plaza. He holds one hand against his chest, the other is outstretched -- palm flat to the air.",
		"\"But was it all worth it? Everything that came before -- Cindy, the stocks, the thing with Idiot Doom Spiral...\"",
		"\"Who?\" The lieutenant meets your eyes with a questioning glance -- then looks up again.",
		"\"You managed to gather quite a fortune, kicked off by underpaying a young artist...\"",
		"\"Sure, whenever you're ready.\"",
		"He nods. The roundabout is quiet, almost eerily so under the brilliant sunlight. The formless complexion glows at the centre, while the old architecture surrounding it groans in the heat with looming irrelevance...",
		"He holds the position for two seconds, then relaxes, turning to face you...",
		"\"One more question, if you don't mind -- was it all worth it?\"",
		"\"Tax? What tax? We're in Revachol.\" He looks around, as if looking for hidden taxation, then shakes his head.",
		"\"Sure, whenever you're ready.\"",
		"He nods. The roundabout is quiet, almost eerily so under the brilliant sun. The king of disco is lit up like a stage, anticipating a funky beat that will never come...",
		"He nods. The roundabout is quiet, almost eerily so under the brilliant sunlight. The tickets remain true to their duty -- except for a few that have come unstuck, now assigned to brushing dirt from the asphalt below...",
		"\"Ah yes. Spoken like a true businessman.\" He smiles gently.",
		"He nods, eyes still on the ticket creature above, on the hundreds of parking notes rustling like feathers in the cold air.",
		"\"Detective, I have a few questions if you don't mind...\"",
		"\"But was it all worth it? Everything that came before -- Cindy, the stocks, the thing with Idiot Doom Spiral...\"",
		"\"I don't think anything. I'm just asking questions.\"",
		"He nods. The roundabout is quiet, almost eerily so under the brilliant sunlight. The penumbral griever is a silhouette against the bright sky, the flowers lifting him in requiem starting to wilt...",
		"\"You managed to gather quite a fortune, kicked off by underpaying a young artist...\"",
		"\"Hard to disagree with the sentiment considering what we just survived.\" The lieutenant solemnly looks toward the plaza, then turns to you.",
		"\"I don't think anything. I'm just asking questions.\"",
		"He nods. The roundabout is quiet, almost eerily so under the brilliant sunlight. The formless complexion glows at the centre, while the old architecture surrounding it groans in the heat with looming irrelevance...",

		"\"One more question, if you don't mind -- was it all worth it?\"",
		"He nods. The roundabout is quiet, almost eerily so under the brilliant sunlight. The doom crier waits to be swallowed by the bright sky, his cardboard omen flapping in the wind like live bait...",
		"\"Alright, shall we? We still have some things left to do before we can go home.\"",
		"\"Is this a parody? It's... not bad.\" The lieutenant looks towards the plaza and sighs. \"We're lucky to to be able to enjoy this.\"",
		"\"Khm,\" the lieutenant clears his throat, keen to move on.",
		"\"Sure, whenever you're ready.\"",
		"\"And was it all worth it?\"",
		"He nods. The roundabout is quiet, almost eerily so under the brilliant sun. The king of disco is lit up like a stage, anticipating a funky beat that will never come...",

		"He nods in dutiful agreement then closes his eyes for half a beat. When he opens them, it's clear he has something to say to you...",
		"\"Never mind. Another question -- was it all worth it?\"",
		"\"But was it all worth it? Everything that came before -- Cindy, the stocks, even the street lamp.\"",
		"\"Ah yes. Spoken like a true businessman.\" He smiles gently.",

		"He nods, eyes still on the megastar above, his face tinged by the citrus beams warming the cold air.",
		"\"Sure, whenever you're ready.\"",
		"\"Never mind. Another question -- was it all worth it?\"",
		"\"Okay.\" The lieutenant snaps shut like a world-ending implosion.",
		"\"And was it all worth it?\"",
		"\"Sure, whenever you're ready.\"",
		"\"Ah yes. Spoken like a true philanthropist.\" He smiles gently.",
		"\"I don't think anything. I'm just asking questions.\"",

		"\"You managed to gather quite a fortune, kicked off by underpaying a young artist...\"",
		"Somewhere in a hospital bed the lieutenant turns onto his side, feverish and exhausted...",
		"You can feel the lieutenant's stillness next to you...",
		"He nods. The roundabout is quiet, almost eerily so under the brilliant sunlight. The doom crier waits to be swallowed by the bright sky, his cardboard omen flapping in the wind like live bait...",
		"\"Ah yes. Spoken like a true businessman.\" He smiles gently.",

		"\"Detective, I have a few questions if you don't mind...\"",
		"\"Why did you do it?\"",
		"\"Detective, I have a few questions if you don't mind...\"",
		"\"Ah yes. Spoken like a true philanthropist.\" He smiles gently.",

		"He nods, eyes still on the veiled apparition above, on the troves and troves of flowers below, their sickly sweet scent pungent in the cold air.",
		"He nods. The roundabout is quiet, almost eerily so under the brilliant sunlight. The penumbral griever is a silhouette against the bright sky, the flowers lifting him in requiem starting to wilt...",

		"\"Ah yes. Spoken like a true philanthropist.\" He smiles gently.",
		"\"Who?\" The lieutenant meets your eyes with a questioning glance -- then looks up again.",

		"\"I don't think anything. I'm just asking questions.\"",
		"He nods in woeful agreement then closes his eyes for half a beat. When he opens them, it's clear he has something to say to you...",
		"He nods, eyes still on the defaced statue above, on the deviant smear delivering a florid punch to its dreary surroundings.",
		"\"Who?\" The lieutenant meets your eyes with a questioning glance -- then looks up again.",

		"\"Ah yes. Spoken like a true philanthropist.\" He smiles gently.",
		"\"One more question, if you don't mind -- was it all worth it?\"",
		"\"One more question, if you don't mind -- was it all worth it?\"",

		"The lieutenant considers the restoration for a few seconds. \"Am I not seeing something here? There's not much to it.\"",
		"\"Okay.\" The lieutenant snaps shut like a lid on a paint tin.",
		"You can feel the lieutenant's stillness next to you...",
		"\"I don't think anything. I'm just asking questions.\"",
		"\"But was it all worth it? Everything that came before -- Cindy, the stocks, even the street lamp.\"",
		"\"Alright, shall we? We still have some things left to do before we can go home.\"",
		"\"Everyone understands you're *the law*. That's why you have that insignia on your arm. So you don't have to keep saying it.\"",
		"\"Okay. Of course.\" The lieutenant says, his voice a soothing calm. He looks at you.",
		"\"Actually...\" The lieutenant turns to you. \"I think we should maybe even *get going* now?\"",
		"\"It would be better -- for the neighbourhood -- if you went home. At least for now. If you can't get in anyway.\"",
		"\"Why not? I see *numerous* reasons not to pick a side in this local matter.\"",
		"The lieutenant turns to you. \"I think we should maybe even *get going* now?\"",
		"\"We're not picking a side in this just yet, sir.\"",
		"\"I have a question.\" The lieutenant looks him in the eye. \"Why do all these men follow your leadership?\"",
		"\"Yes, people get that you are *the law*. You really don't have to keep saying it.\"",
		"\"He's not the only one, it seems.\" The lieutenant doesn't even look up from his notebook.",
		"\"She said that you would need some kind of *passphrase* to gain access to this so-called *mega secret* meeting.\" He snaps the elastic band around his notebook.",
		"\"Not to interfere in your personal errand, but it might have something to do with that *passphrase* Cindy mentioned earlier.\"",
		"The lieutenant nods.",
		"\"All of it?\" The lieutenant raises his brow. \"There are junior officers out there, eager to prove themselves. I would leave *some* for them, but okay. Let's find *all of it*.\"",
		"\"Okay, but where did you get the key from?\"",
		"\"How *does* it come off?\"",
		"\"You're right. How foolish of me. Won't happen again, detective.\"",
		"\"Laziness, self-interest, and negligence certainly fit the doctrine espoused here.\"",
		"\"I agree, officer. Let's focus on the hanging and later some junior officers can take care of the rest.\"",
		"\"*Ahem*...\" The lieutenant clears his throat.",
		"\"Because we don't. We don't have air support -- or any of those other things.\"",
		"\"At least some people are willing to make the necessary sacrifices in order to reach higher, and to better the world.\"",
		"\"Nice and balanced,\" the lieutenant nods. \"Some junior officers can take care of the rest.\"",
		"\"By that you mean corruption?\"",
		"\"It's certainly been an interesting development to witness first-hand.\"",
		"\"All of it?\" The lieutenant raises his brow. \"There are junior officers out there, eager to prove themselves. I would leave *some* for them -- and I would leave the *boots* to Processing -- but okay. Let's find *all of it*.\"",
		"\"Understood.\" The lieutenant takes a note. \"This has been of limited use -- still, thank you.\"",
		"\"Of course you were, detective. Apologies for interrupting.\" The lieutenant smiles to himself.",
		"Lieutenant Kitsuragi picks up the coin and hands it to you.",
		"\"What happened?\"",
		"\"Did you?\"",
		"\"What else?\"",
		"\"He can be very *enterprising*...\" The lieutenant looks at his feet, hiding his face.",
		"\"Yes, he certainly has a way of just coming out and saying things that normal people wouldn't.\"",
		"\"Oh, he certainly likes to take his time with things, especially when politics are at issue.\"",
		"\"Okay.\" The lieutenant keeps it laconic.",
		"\"I highly doubt that. When I crank the volume on my DynaWave, it's like you're in the front row at the National Concert Hall.\"",
		"\"Okay.\" The lieutenant keeps it laconic.",
		"\"Back across the waterlock. At least we're getting our *exercise* in today.\"",
		"\"Not even the RCM has access to that kind of equipment. The Coalition is extremely possessive of its frequency bands.\"",
		"\"Okay.\" The lieutenant keeps it laconic.",
		"\"Forget it.\" He waves his hand. \"It would become an imbecilic discussion. You two continue. It's more *hard core* that way.\"",
		"\"Yes, you two have grown *quite* close over the last few days. Always doing little *errands* for each other.\"",
		"Hmmm, this really didn't seem like it was going to be that hard. We'll just have to try again...",
		"\"Something tells me Ms. Messier would be *less than thrilled* to hear you'd like to commandeer her boat so you can talk to a Coalition warship.\"",
		"\"Joke all you want, detective. Whatever radio you manage to scrounge up won't lay a *finger* on my set-up.\"",
		"\"I'm not sure I'd use the word 'friendly' to describe Mr. Claire's attitude toward us.\"",
		"\"Yes. You really came through. For the hard core underground.\" He spreads his arms, looking around at the speedfreaks setting up shop. \"How come?\"",
		"\"Khm,\" the lieutenant interjects: \"There is a difference between narcotics and group elation. One kills you, the other does not.\"",
		"The lieutenant politely averts his eyes as you make a drug deal in a house of worship, but make no mistake: He's *less than thrilled* about it.",
		"\"Okay.\" The lieutenant keeps it laconic.",
		"\"And before you ask: No, you can't have the radio from my Kineema either.\"",
		"\"It would also be incredibly stupid. Detective, did you not take Elementary Radio Operations? I thought it was an RCM-wide requirement.\"",
		"\"Okay.\" The lieutenant keeps it laconic.",
		"\"There always is.\"",
		"\"Please, stop doing this. You're making us look bad.\"",
		"\"Khm...\"",
		"\"And who are you?\" The lieutenant fires back. \"What is your business here? Why are your clothes four sizes too small for you?\"",
		"\"I think this racist is better than the last -- but the next racist will be the really good one.\"",
		"\"Do you?\" The lieutenant looks at you.",
		"\"You go ahead and have your talk,\" says the lieutenant, glancing over the railing. \"I need a few things from Frittte anyways. We'll catch up later.\"",
		"\"We still need to get into the harbour. There is an interview to conduct. There must be another way...\"",
		"\"Spoken by a mercenary -- pretending to be a worker.\"",
		"\"We still need to get into the harbour. We need help with the tree situation. There must be another way...\"",
		"\"We still need to get into the harbour. There is an interview to conduct. There must be another way...\" His gaze wanders over the Whirling's roof to the yard.",
		"\"Yes. It would seem *nonsensical*.\"",
		"\"Finally.\" The lieutenant impatiently gestures toward the door. \"Let's go.\"",
		"\"Let's go, officer.\" The lieutenant puts his hand on your shoulder. \"Let's go do some work.\"",
		"\"Interesting.\" The lieutenant takes a quick note.",
		"\"Perhaps we should go and do some work now?\"",
		"\"There must be another way to accomplish police work -- without *racecraft*.\"",
		"\"No one is the new Measurehead -- let's go. Before he gets up...\" The lieutenant makes haste toward the door.",
		"\"I don't think anything about this. We're wasting our time having this conversation.\"",
		"\"Access to the Union is important for our investigation, but there may be another way in... Without becoming a race theoretician.\"",
		"\"This is the uncomfortable result of not taking it down ourselves. I can live with the compromise.\"",
		"\"He will grant us three wishes.\"",
		"\"It's not good.\"",
		"The lieutenant does not flinch.",
		"The lieutenant nods, ready to spend some time on his own.",
		"\"We still need to get into the harbour. We need help with the tree situation. There must be another way...\" His gaze wanders over the Whirling's roof to the yard.",
		"The lieutenant looks toward the harbour's electronic door and then to you. He lets out an audible sigh.",
		"\"Well done.\" The lieutenant impatiently gestures toward the door. \"Let's go.\"",
		"\"You hear that?\" The lieutenant looks toward the yard. \"That sound. He's *breaking* something.\"",
		"\"Hmh.\" He seems surprised at your choice of racist, but then slowly nods.",
		"\"What thing? We already got *in* the harbour. You just want to hear about races, don't you?\"",
		"\"Possibly because there's a strike going on in the harbour. There's not much to do -- aside from drinking and sleeping.\"",
		"\"To be honest, he is correct. Police officers generally don't go around *appropriating* possessions from people. Let's go.\"",
		"No. He's looking the other way -- perhaps purposefully.",
		"\"No idea. Looks like he works for Wild Pines, the logistics company who owns and operates the harbour.\"",
		"The lieutenant gives you a little nod -- then makes a note in his blue notebook.",
		"\"Me neither.\" The lieutenant looks weary of this whole situation. \"I don't think anyone did.\"",
		"\"May bells don't blossom yet, do they?\" the lieutenant quickly asks.",
		"\"Now, gentlemen...\" The lieutenant addresses the men in a casual manner. \"If my partner doesn't have any other questions, we'll take off.\"",
		"\"Purple velvet tunic,\" the lieutenant says thoughtfully. \"That isn't exactly *camo*.\"",
		"\"No. It isn't. He's absolutely right.\" He shakes his head. \"I don't like it and I feel confident saying absolutely *no one* in your precinct would approve of this either.\"",
		"\"Excellent job bullying that old man, officer,\" the lieutenant says with a frown. He looks impatient and not happy. \"He'll be sure to put in a good word for the RCM in the future.\"",
		"\"He's right, you know?\" The lieutenant nods towards René. \"We're supposed to protect people -- not take advantage of them. Now wrap this up.\"",
		"\"We're not, the officer was just...\" The lieutenant falls silent, looking for words to justify your sandwich antics.",
		"\"Yes, indeed. We are not here to investigate the drug trade of centuries past.\"",
		"\"No one has been guarding the container yard since last Monday?\"",
		"\"Yes, well...\" The lieutenant looks uncomfortable. \"Let's just wrap this up and try to think about these things in the future.\"",
		"\"Of course,\" the lieutenant marks dryly. \"Clarity of vision. *Awareness*.\"",
		"\"Not this again...\" you hear the lieutenant mumble under his breath.",
		"\"If you have more questions, don't hesitate to ask.\"",
		"Calmly the lieutenant looks out of the window, then to you licking the tasty rum stain off the counter -- but only a *little* -- then out of the window again.",
		"\"What are you doing?\" he asks without turning his eyes from the street outside.",
		"\"We should move.\"",
		"\"What are you doing?\" he asks without turning his eyes from the street outside.",
		"Calmly the lieutenant looks out of the window, then to you licking the tasty rum stain off the counter, then out of the window again.",
		"\"No, it's not *shatterproof*. Give me that.\" He takes the prybar from you and gestures for you to step back. Then, with little warning...",
		"\"What? I happen to have committed the frequency to memory. I have no problem admitting that.\"",
		"\"Sandpaper?\" the lieutenant repeats. \"A novel technique... Must be to offer some extra grip to the driver's foot.\"",
		"\"We definitely need to return some time later.\" He nods at the lorry. \"We didn't get enough.\"",
		"\"...with *cool* names,\" he adds with contempt. \"Like *La Puta Madre* and *Ahura Mazda*. It's a dark parody.\"",
		"\"Use the prybar to smash the window. Open it from the inside.\"",
		"The lieutenant leans over your shoulder to examine the note: \"The ULAN frequency system? I've never heard of that before. I know of FM, AM, UKV, but...\" His thought trails off.",
		"\"Hard to say. This distribution network looks certainly large, yet still vague enough... It doesn't reveal much about the *besmertie* behind it.\"",
		"\"This has been hard enough. No need to make it any harder.\" The lieutenant takes the prybar from you and gestures for you to step back. Then, with short warning...",
		"\"Mhm,\" he nods and gives you the tool back. \"It went better than I expected -- open it from the inside.\"",
		"\"Doesn't look like it -- it's completely inoperable without the dial key.\"",
		"\"Yes, well...\" He quickly disregards your statement as another one of your  neurotic outbursts.",
		"\"To be perfectly frank, I have my reservations about this whole antenna scheme. But who knows? We may yet be surprised.\"",
		"\"What a novel technique...\" The lieutenant leans closer. \"You sure do know your lorries, officer.\"",
		"\"We should talk with Titus, see what he's got to say on the matter.\" He writes something down into his little notebook. \"Are we finished with the lorry?\"",
		"\"This has been hard enough. No need to make it any harder.\"",
		"\"Understood. We should still go and see what Titus has got to say on the matter.\" He writes something down into his little notebook. \"Are we finished with the lorry?\"",
		"\"We should see what Titus has got to say on the matter.\" He writes something down into his little notebook. \"Are we finished with the lorry?\"",
		"\"Great, I think we got everything. A word, detective?\" He steps away from the lorry. \"*Before* we return to Joyce.\"",
		"\"Let's get the prybar from my Kineema and smash in the window.\"",
		"\"I'm more interested in *why* you're so fixated on this idea in the first place.\"",
		"\"But now you've got what you came for, so I suppose we'll have to see this business through.\"",
		"\"*You* could reach the Coalition and have your talk about *la responsabilité*... *I* could grow 10 centimetres and become a flanker for the Stormers.\"",
		"\"I certainly understand the impulse, but this is our job, detective. Our whole *raison d'être*. At some point, we'll need to return to it.\"",
		"\"Looks like we're dealing with an impressive organizational tool -- the nerve centre of a huge operation. With quite the range too.\"",
		"\"Let me make a prediction, detective. You are not going to see the inside of a Coalition warship anytime soon.\"",
		"\"So it would seem.\" The lieutenant examines the maps with a furrowed brow.",
		"\"Oh, I didn't mean that. It's just ironic that you're using the lady driver's radio to contact the very authorities she was so keen to evade.\"",
		"\"An Esterhaz is certainly nothing to sniff at.\" The lieutenant nods. \"But if you compare the feature sets, I would say they're more-or-less equivalent.\"",
		"\"Best not to disturb the scene.\" The lieutenant nods. \"I'll have Forensics go over the lorry and pick these up later.\"",
		"\"Yes, another draw. It appears we are quite equally matched.\"",
		"\"I've no reason to be jealous, detective.\" The lieutenant smiles to himself.",
		"\"It's definitely not the Union. They just do *some* logistics. This operation has spread everywhere in Jamrock. If it's that widespread, then Madre remains the most likely suspect.\"",
		"\"For contacting an entire fleet of lorrymen, for example.\" He flicks a switch on the radio. \"This is all shortwave, UW and UKV...\"",
		"\"I don't know how *good* it is, but this investigation has taken long enough. We can't afford it to take any longer.\"",
		"\"So it would appear.\"",
		"\"This must be the one he told us about. Unless he was lying...\" The lieutenant peeks inside.",
		"\"*Bonne prise*,\" the lieutenant commends you as you shift through the treasure -- well worn and folded into neat squares.",
		"The lieutenant leans closer to the radio and hums: \"Strange. There are so many radio stations saved here... must be over one hundred at least.\"",
		"\"It's not really a *joke*, per se. Just ironic that you're using the lady driver's radio to contact the very authorities she was so keen to evade.\"",
		"\"I wouldn't like to guess. Your performance so far doesn't exactly inspire confidence, but all sorts of things are possible...\"",
		"\"At least we can now ask Titus some concrete questions about it.\"",
		"\"He's *bad news*.\" The lieutenant removes his glasses and polishes them with a handkerchief. \"There have been attempts at a serious investigation before, but they... haven't ended well for those involved.\"",
		"\"The RCM patrols most of these auxiliary roads, though apparently not all of them.\"",
		"\"Sandpaper?\" the lieutenant repeats. \"A novel technique...\"",
		"\"It should. Assuming we can find a way to replace the frequency dial.\"",
		"\"Looks like her, yes.\"",
		"\"Funny, isn't it?\"",
		"Not without the dial key, no.",
		"\"You've surprised me more than once during the course of our investigation, but I have to say it still seems like a *remote* scenario.\" He shrugs.",
		"\"But here's the thing, detective. *We're* the proper channels. Doing our work, right here on the ground, is how we'll solve this case. There's no need to bring the Coalition into this.\"",
		"\"Subtle,\" says the lieutenant and sticks his hand in the window -- like a common car thief -- and then opens it.",
		"\"No, that's on 78.9.\" He stops, coughing awkwardly.",
		"\"It means that the smugglers are secretly using the motorway to transport their goods and materials. They've infiltrated East Motor Tract, most likely...\"",
		"\"Now we know for *certain* who's the missing eighth person at the lynching. Do you think that Hardie and his boys could also be involved in the drug operation?\"",
		"\"We've identified one of the footprints, but there are still seven to go...\" He writes something in his little blue notebook.",
		"\"Which means that the missing lady driver was present at the lynching.\" The lieutenant's eyes light up behind his prescription lens.",
		"\"Who's to say what's possible and what's not?\"",
		"\"Yes?\" He likes where this is going...",
		"\"This is the one our man pointed to...\" The lieutenant peeks inside.",
		"\"The lady driver used this same radio to evade Coalition authorities, and now you're using it to contact them directly. It's just ironic, that's all.\"",
		"\"A besmertie is a Revacholian crime syndicate. They see themselves as the inheritors of the 14 Revacholian indotribes, but really they're just violent gangs vying for control on the West side of Revachol...\"",
		"\"You're right. But we should still go and see what Titus has got to say on the matter.\" He writes something down into his little notebook. \"Are we finished with the lorry?\"",
		"\"That's right. When not spying on the love affairs of the ultra-rich, we solve unusual mysteries by the lorry-load.\"",
		"\"Yes, what Martinaise really needs is more vigilantes roaming the streets.\"",
		"The lieutenant shoots you a sideways glance. \"And I am his private partner, John... Shao. Together we run the pre-eminent spousal surveillance firm in Revachol.\"",
		"\"Our sincere apologies, ma'am. No more nonsense. We're offering to assist you with your troubles, *pro bono*.\" Despite his apologies, there's a twinge of amusement in the lieutenant's eye.",
		"\"We wouldn't want that.\"",
		"\"I am sorry we had to disappoint you, ma'am.\" He turns to you. \"Can we go now?\"",
		"\"If you're really interested in cracking this mystery, then we should go back to the furnace. Maybe you could yell into it or something, make some noise? You'll think of something, you always do.\"",
		"\"Ma'am -- what he's saying is true. We found an entroponetic anomaly in the Small Pinewood Church down the coast. I don't mean to be an alarmist -- and more research *is* needed -- but... it's not looking good.\"",
		"He turns away, but not before you can see a small hint of a smile -- he's struggling to not crack up.",
		"\"Well, this has been absolutely *educational*. If we happen on the *Third Presence* in our travels we will certainly come back to tell you.\"",
		"\"You're no para-detective. You look nothing like one -- and you're clearly a drinker. Pardon me for being so blunt, but...\"",
		"\"Certainly so, ma'am. I can assure you my partner is eminent in this *particular* field.\"",
		"\"Oh, uh...\" the lieutenant mumbles in minor confusion. He has not been listening closely enough. You've put him on the spot.",
		"The lieutenant looks at you, waiting to see where this is going.",
		"\"Yes, we've had quite enough fun here, right.\" The lieutenant taps his foot.",
		"\"I can assure you, he is... a police officer. Very... knowledgeable.\"",
		"\"All right then -- all's well that ends well.\" The lieutenant turns to you. \"Should we return to our *ordinary* lives?\"",
		"\"Come on, ma'am. It's obvious she can't do anything about it. You're placing an unnecessary burden on a young child.\"",
		"\"Once we've caught our client's spouse *in flagrante delicto*, we blackmail them and pocket the money ourselves, because that's what private investigators do. Now, I see that *you* are a married woman...\"",
		"The lieutenant keeps his usual stony calm. He silently picks out his notebook.",
		"He turns to you. \"Should we get out of here -- before the *vortex* collapses?\"",
		"\"To the cellar?\" the lieutenant suggests. \"Quick, she's turning around...\"",
		"\"What do you see?\" the lieutenant asks, whispering conspiratorially.",
		"\"No, what do you *really* see?\"",
		"\"You're hopeless,\" he sighs. \"Quick, she's turning around...\"",
		"\"I see,\" the lieutenant nods, before looking at the shopkeeper: \"Quick, she's turning around...\"",
		"\"Spooky,\" the lieutenant comments. \"Quick, she's turning around...\"",
		"\"We should come back in the morning.\"",
		"\"Hey! What is your problem?\"",
		"\"This is the police. Can we come in?\"",
		"The lieutenant gives you a quick glance.",
		"\"Stop that!\" The lieutenant sounds angry.",
		"\"For what it's worth -- I agree. But cockatoos can't be stopped when they get like this. It's better to indulge him at this point.\"",
		"\"Or they don't -- and you'll never find them,\" he adds with a flash of teeth.",
		"\"Everyone can see that. The rectangles.\" He points to his sleeve.",
		"\"All right then...\" He sighs. \"He has *questions* now.\"",
		"\"Great, let's do it.\"",
		"\"I wouldn't be so sure,\" he replies, before turning to face the working class woman.",
		"\"I'd say there's nothing mysterious about incompleteness. It's in fact rather unpleasant.\"",
		"\"Why did you say that your husband resembles me then?\"",
		"\"This was a tremendously useful interlude.\"",
		"\"Because people either show up on their own or you'll never find them,\" he says with a flash of teeth.",
		"The lieutenant looks worried. \"We can take a break if you're feeling unwell,\" he says to you under his breath.",
		"\"Ma'am, just to be completely clear -- do you want to report it to the police?\"",
		"\"I'm sure he will too. When he does, would you let Precinct 57 -- Kim Kitsuragi -- know.\" He gives her a slip of paper.",
		"\"Where is this going, officer?\"",
		"\"They're not all they're cracked up to be, officer.\"",
		"The lieutenant sighs.",
		"\"That's odd. I could swear you were a *police officer*...\"",
		"\"Really? I don't have the eyesight to make it out...\" The lieutenant takes off his glasses and cleans them.",
		"\"Can you tell? From this distance? I don't think it's possible.\"",
		"\"There was a revitalization project in '49. A design studio tried restoring Martinaise to its pre-war glory.\" The lieutenant looks around and concludes: \"It didn't stick.\"",
		"\"We should have *done* something about the Union ten years ago. That ship has sailed, officer.\"",
		"The lieutenant adjusts his collar. It's frisky outside.",
		"\"They got as far as the street lamps and the statue on that intersection. Then something went sour.\" He lowers his voice. \"I suspect that *something* was Evrart Claire -- the Union leader. He muscled them out. It's how it usually goes around here.\"",
		"\"Probably some kids...\" The lieutenant inspects the rigged slot.",
		"\"We'll just have to go in and see.\"",
		"\"This must be for the front door. Pity it doesn't have the apartment number on it. This building has many apartments and the man can be in any of them...\"",
		"\"This must be for the front door. Let's see if it works.\"",
		"\"This could be our witness.\"",
		"\"Look, a smoker on the balcony.\"",
		"\"And when did you speak to this more *muscular* gentleman?\" The lieutenant takes out his little blue notebook and writes something down.",
		"\"We will remove the body as soon as possible. Now tell us, where were you last Sunday?\"",
		"\"He could be a witness, him or his *Sunday friend*. Either way we need to look into that *muscular type* who's asking about our case...\"",
		"\"No point in running. Tenements like these often have multiple exits. If he doesn't want to talk to us, then he'll know how to hide himself.\"",
		"\"There has to be a way of getting inside the building -- let's go check out the door near the pier again. Once we've found the way in, we can ask around for his apartment.\"",
		"\"What were you doing last Sunday?\"",
		"\"There has to be a way of getting inside the building. Once we've found the way in, we can ask around for his apartment.\"",
		"\"He did leave us a sign, did you see that? He wanted to draw our attention to that stone right over there.\" The lieutenant nods towards a small rock on a soggy patch of grass.",
		"\"You didn't answer the question. What were you doing last Sunday?\"",
		"\"He's gone.\" The lieutenant puts away his notebook and turns to you.",
		"\"He could be a witness, him or his *Sunday friend*. It's worth looking into...\"",
		"\"If we find a way inside the building, we can ask around for his apartment.\"",
		"\"He could be a witness. And either way we need to look into that *muscular type* who's asking about our case...\"",
		"\"He could be a witness. We shouldn't rule out the possibility...\"",
		"\"Now that I'm looking at it... maybe a glass-doored fridge in a public grocery store isn't the best option for storing a corpse.\"",
		"\"No need to worry.\" The lieutenant's voice is soothing and professional. \"It's just standard procedure for us to ask around. If you hear anything, let us know. Okay?\"",
		"\"Businesses often hire private security this side of the river. It's an unfortunate state of affairs, but not unheard of.\"",
		"\"Excuse us -- my partner here of course knows that net worth is not *legal tender*.\" The lieutenant gives you a quick glance.",
		"The lieutenant frowns at you, before turning to the clerk with an apologetic half-smile.",
		"\"We are not the fashion police.\" The lieutenant looks at you. \"We're the real police.\"",
		"\"Who *exactly* is talking about this lady-driver of yours? The racist? Or the other one, with the tattoos?\" He points north.",
		"\"The *Apricot Suzerainty*,\" the lieutenant explains, \"is what the Siigay archipelago is commonly known as in Revachol.\" He pauses. \"It's a bit of a *fraught* term, I'm sure you understand.\"",
		"\"It is, yes. Anyone can set up their shop whenever they feel like it.\"",
		"\"If you wanted to be *cynical* about it, you could say we're here to protect the interests of property holders. I'm not, however.\"",
		"\"Interesting.\" The lieutenant whips out his blue notebook and makes a note.",
		"\"No use -- he's not telling us. He's too afraid. We need to take him to my station and ask him there. *After* we've called his boss.\"",
		"The lieutenant winces at the words -- slightly.",
		"\"And what *crowd* is that?\"",
		"The lieutenant nods calmly and says: \"Corruption.\"",
		"\"So you admit you're a lorry driver?\"",
		"\"It is not code. He really means his individual net worth,\" the lieutenant jumps in. \"It is *not* legal tender.\"",
		"The lieutenant nods approvingly.",
		"\"Are you trying to ask for a *bribe*? If so, you're not doing a very good job...\" He looks at the vendor.",
		"\"The third driver,\" he nods. \"We haven't talked to her yet. Where exactly is she -- near the horseback monument?\"",
		"\"He does not need your money. Please disregard that. We're just here to ask some questions.\"",
		"\"I don't think you really understand how bribes work, detective...\" He looks at you, then the vendor.",
		"\"I hope not,\" he says, looking up from his browsing.",
		"\"No, I can't... We can't walk around with you looking like this.\" His hand has already risen mid-air, but he stops. \"Okay, fine. Go ahead. If you want to look like a walking mid-life crisis, then who am I to interfere?\"",
		"\"You look like a musician,\" he declares, eyes still squinted behind his own glasses. \"Like a *blind* musician. But you could do worse. Take them if you want.\"",
		"\"A pity,\" the lieutenant says. \"Those actually weren't half bad.\"",
		"\"No,\" the lieutenant gently removes the glasses from your face, setting you free again. \"You're definitely not buying those.\"",
		"The lieutenant tilts his head and steps back, eyes narrowed in a thorough examination. It's a case to him.",
		"\"Did you see that?\" The lieutenant nods towards the vehicle. \"The seals on the humanitarian aid lorry have been broken off.\"",
		"\"Yes, absolutely,\" he agrees, while his eyes turn to the traffic jam. \"But I suggest we keep our eyes open around that streethawker we met before.\"",
		"\"Yes, absolutely,\" the lieutenant agrees, while his eyes scan the traffic jam. \"But let's keep our eyes open nevertheless.\"",
		"\"You may be right,\" he agrees, scanning the jam. \"Let's keep our eyes open.\"",
		"\"You may be right. Let's see what he's got to say.\"",
		"\"Good to know that we were right,\" the lieutenant remarks dryly. \"Would have *sucked* to rip a man off for no reason at all.\"",
		"\"Yes,\" nods the lieutenant, \"Humanox is a well-known humanitarian aid organization. It must be the streethawker's truck.\"",
		"\"Mhmh. I don't have time to explain it to you right now. Maybe some time later...\" He looks at the sea, almost wistful.",
		"\"I don't know what happened either.\" The lieutenant inspects the doorbell. \"We should probably stop playing with this thing.\"",
		"\"I see.\" There is an impenetrable expression on the lieutenant's face.",
		"\"I see.\" The lieutenant doesn't ask more.",
		"The lieutenant exchanges a look with you.",
		"\"It must have been some kind of... faulty wiring. We should maybe stop playing with this doorbell, it looks ancient.\"",
		"\"No, not a window-related one.\"",
		"\"No idea,\" he shrugs. The three-worded business name stands cryptic among the others:",
		"\"So...\" The strange, alien thought pattern ends. The lieutenant cuts in, inspecting the intercom.",
		"\"Don't take this the wrong way, but -- during our short stint working together -- *something weird* is almost always happening to you.\"",
		"\"Hmm... this button looks new. It's probably not connected yet.\" He takes a step back, inspecting the other names on the list.",
		"\"You just keep on beating those things, don't you?\"",
		"\"Hmm... this button looks new. I wouldn't be surprised if it hasn't been connected yet. Is it the dicemaker's?\" He takes a step back, inspecting the other names on the list.",
		"\"In any case, I'm afraid you won't get any help here.\" He looks up to the towering ghost house. \"This place is deserted.\"",
		"\"It was a recording trapped in the circuitry. From some ancient tenant. This sometimes happens. Shall we conclude here? We have other mysteries to solve.\"",
		"\"Khm...\" says the lieutenant. \"That's unsanitary.\" (It probably is.)",
		"The lieutenant sighs but says nothing. He looks up at the building.",
		"\"Yes, I've been meaning to ask about that... What happened?\"",
		"\"My money's on *electrical anomaly*. I've heard of these. Especially in an old building like this...\" He looks around.",
		"\"Agreed,\" the lieutenant chips in, \"pinball is the worst.\"",
		"\"Creative.\" The lieutenant looks around the spacious room, its ceiling fading into shadows above.",
		"\"I've already learned about horrors like *pale* and I can't take any further risks.\"",
		"\"Miss, I apologize for my colleague's behaviour. He's still recovering from an *unusual* medical episode...\"",
		"\"It's not real, ma'am. He's making it up.\"",
		"The lieutenant looks at his notebook, then the woman under the large window...",
		"\"Your window looks directly onto the courtyard. You're saying you didn't see or hear *anything* unusual last Sunday evening?\"",
		"\"Men like that are a curse.\" The lieutenant is stern.",
		"\"Miss, I apologize for my colleague's behaviour. He's still recovering from an *unusual* medical episode...\"",
		"\"I'm afraid it is, ma'am. Soona Luukanen-Kilde, the former lead programmer of Fortress Accident, made the discovery.\"",
		"\"Officer!\" The lieutenant exclaims sharply.",
		"\"Don't worry, the ICP has a separate division that deals exclusively with unlicensed sub rosas,\" the lieutenant turns to you. \"This isn't our problem.\"",
		"\"And *this* protects you?\"",
		"\"Hmm, maybe you should let your voice rest, officer. Try again later.\"",
		"\"Please wipe your face clean, officer.\"",
		"\"What are you doing?\" the lieutenant asks when he sees you climb half-way inside the furnace.",
		"\"Thank you,\" the lieutenant nods. \"So, where were we?\" He turns back to the furnace.",
		"\"We should ask the lady in the bookstore what's going on with these curtains.\"",
		"\"Wait, really?\" He looks up at the ceiling. \"Maybe it's coming from behind those safety curtains we saw upstairs?\"",
		"\"Wait, really?\" He looks up at the ceiling. \"We should investigate, see if someone's upstairs.\"",
		"\"Wait, really?\" The lieutenant sounds concerned. \"Take your head out of the chimney, please. It's not safe.\"",
		"\"Looks like it. Looks like an old central furnace used to heat the building. It's connected to the chimney...\" He opens the door and gingerly peeks inside.",
		"The lieutenant seems relieved as well.",
		"\"Yes. Yes, it was,\" the lieutenant nods, before turning back to the furnace.",
		"\"What... what are you doing?\"",
		"\"No one has used it in ages... No signs of any recent fire, only dead rats.\"",
		"\"Okay, sure. Go ahead.\" He stubbornly looks away from you and the furnace.",
		"\"You're right, the rooms do look like they're connected. But *malignant Entities* don't exist -- at least not the *supra-natural* kind.\"",
		"The lieutenant nods, then points upstairs. \"After you, officer.\"",
		"\"Great. The owners of this building will just have to keep paying for the electricity sucked up by this monstrosity a little longer. Let's return to the fridge.\"",
		"The lieutenant raises his brows, but doesn't say anything. The electric distribution board now has one cable missing.",
		"\"Great. The owners of this building will just have to keep paying for the electricity sucked up by this monstrosity a little longer.\"",
		"\"Very smart. Opening the lid should be much easier after the ice cream maker has defrosted. But we're still going to need a proper prybar.\"",
		"\"Very smart. Opening the lid should be much easier after the ice cream maker has defrosted.\"",
		"\"Why did you do that?\"",
		"\"Uh, what are you doing? We need the fridge for the body, you can't just unplug it.\" He takes the cable and plugs it back in.",
		"\"A scoop of ice cream would have been nice, yes,\" the lieutenant agrees. Someone's stomach grumbles. The room feels very cold.",
		"\"Didn't Soona give you a perfect tool for this kind of job -- the Kvalsund? You should take it out.\"",
		"\"We should take it back to Miss Luukanen-Kilde as soon as possible. I'm not sure how well unused filaments tolerate room temperatures.\"",
		"\"I have no idea, officer. This ice cream maker isn't important enough to requisition a special tool.\"",
		"\"Yeah, well, that's a good prybar -- I'm not criticising it -- but this ice cream maker is frozen *shut*. It takes an *advanced* tool to get it open.\"",
		"\"I have a prybar in my Kineema, in case you want to try again. Though it might be that my prybar isn't strong enough for that lid...\" He eyes the ice cream maker suspiciously.",
		"He studies the fridge. \"It's certainly an eccentric choice, but it *is* big enough. And cold enough, too...\"",
		"\"Beautiful,\" he says, wiping his hands in his handkerchief. \"A dead body in an ice bear fridge -- this is some of the best police work I've ever done.\"",
		"\"Shall we go and get the body, then? I'll take the head, you take the feet. The stairs won't be easy, but we'll manage.\"",
		"\"Let's take a look inside.\"",
		"\"At least we've stopped the body from decomposing further. Now you can conduct another inspection. Under controlled *circumstances*.\"",
		"\"Of course. Just a giant, ice bear shaped fridge...\" He relaxes his hand, his face bathed in the harsh light of the open fridge door.",
		"\"Of course you don't. Look at that! What have we *done?* We stuffed a dead body in an ice bear fridge. This does *not* leave this room.\"",
		"The lieutenant doesn't answer, his eyes glued to the animal. It's dark inside its mysterious belly-compartment...",
		"\"I know,\" says the lieutenant, \"what an unfortunate marketing choice.\"",
		"\"What is even worse -- the bear is still costing them money, to this day...\" The lieutenant points at the red snaky cable running from the fridge.",
		"\"Just what we were looking for -- let's see what's inside.\"",
		"\"It's certainly an... eccentric choice. But it is capacious -- and cold enough, too...\"",
		"\"No. Not really. Look at that! What have we done? We stuffed a *dead body in an ice bear fridge*. This story does not leave this room.\"",
		"\"Good question. It looks like an ice cream fridge.\" The lieutenant reaches for one of the wrappers. He studies it in the light.",
		"\"Of course. I'll take the head, you take the feet...\"",
		"\"The electricity bill must be *catastrophic*. On the other hand, it did help us with a certain corpse situation...\"",
		"The lieutenant doesn't answer. His eyes are glued to the animal. A sharp slice of light shines out from its mysterious belly-door...",
		"\"It's not going to be the *easiest* thing in the world, but we'll manage.\"",
		"The lieutenant studies the fridge. \"It's an eccentric choice... but it definitely fits the body. Now the only thing left to do is plug the fridge back in.\"",
		"\"No. They do *not* -- they *need* to hear about our uneventful, boring, downright *conservative* murder investigation.\"",
		"\"Someone must have taken it... What does the note say?\"",
		"\"Hold on...\" The lieutenant inspects the dark interior of the refrigerator. \"There's no use if the fridge isn't working. Let's plug it in first and then return here to move the body.\"",
		"The lieutenant takes a peek inside. His hand has found the holster of his gun.",
		"\"If I were an artist, this would certainly *not* be my vision. I would be much, much more conservative in my work...\"",
		"\"It's certainly an... eccentric choice. But it's more than big enough -- and cold enough. Honestly, it's perfect. All we have to do is plug the fridge back in.\"",
		"\"Of course. A giant, ice bear shaped fridge...\" He relaxes his hand, his face bathed in the harsh light of the open fridge door.",
		"\"I *knew* you would say that! I *knew* this would lead to drinking...\" He shakes his head vigorously. \"No. No more. This is *paganistic* enough -- and it does *not* leave this room.\"",
		"\"Good question. It looks like an ice cream fridge.\" The lieutenant reaches for one of the wrappers. He tries to study it in the darkness.",
		"\"Of course. I'll take the head, you take the feet...\"",
		"\"Did we, though?\" He sighs. \"Okay, maybe we *did*\"",
		"\"At least it's not running them a loss anymore, now that you've un-plugged the cable.\" He points at the red snaky cable running from the fridge.",
		"\"As impressive as the fridge is, this is a *small* victory. Among numerous defeats.\"",
		"\"At least we've stopped the body from decomposing further -- or will have, once you plug the fridge back in. Then you can conduct one more inspection.\"",
		"He nods gravely. \"Talk of the *ice bear sarcophagus* must *not* leave this room.\"",
		"\"It means there are firearms -- breechloaders -- still lying around in Martinaise. This would have been good in our case against Ruby for Titus. Too late for that now, but still -- might be useful down the road...\"",
		"\"It's the same *type* of weapon, yes -- a breechloader. But it's not the same gun. This one's been out of order for *years...* I'm afraid our search for the real murder weapon must continue.\"",
		"\"It means there are firearms -- breechloaders -- still lying around in Martinaise. This could prove useful in our case against Ruby for Titus. Men are easily swayed by the sight of a rifle.\"",
		"\"Seems like an old bunker from the Revolutionary period. Look at all those rifles...\" He points up, at the rifles under the ceiling. \"Must be an old weapons cache.\"",
		"\"It's yours, officer.\" He hands you the gun. \"You found this place.\"",
		"\"An old Belle-Magrave, from the Revolution,\" the lieutenant notes with approval. His eyes are gleaming. \"Seems to no longer be functional, but still -- a beautiful thing, in its own way.\"",
		"\"An old Belle-Magrave rifle -- that's *rare* to find in such good order. Seems to no longer be functional, but still -- rare. Here...\"",
		"The lieutenant steps closer, curious: \"Are these any good?\"",
		"\"It means there are firearms -- albeit inoperable -- still lying around in Martinaise. It's an interesting coincidence, I would say. Might come in useful in the future.\"",
		"\"It's the same *type* of weapon, yes. A breechloader. An interesting coincidence that we should find something so similar. But I'm afraid our search for the real murder weapon must continue.\"",
		"\"Sure,\" he nods and steps closer. \"Okay, here's some more rifles... None of these seem to be working. And oh...\" His hand reaches in, rummaging in the dark...",
		"\"For that we would have to take a closer look at the bullet you found, officer. I wouldn't read too much into this, yet -- what we have discovered here is an *inoperable antique*.\"",
		"\"There is, yes. And there also appears to be something *inside* the hole... Interesting. Do you want to take a look?\"",
		"\"Really? A *plastic poncho*?\" The lieutenant sighs and looks away.",
		"\"Wearing gloves would definitely make it easier,\" the lieutenant agrees.",
		"\"No one does, until they get smashed under the barbell.\"",
		"\"Proper weightlifting gloves would definitely afford a better grip,\" the lieutenant agrees.",
		"\"At the station gym, I mean. I prefer running. It clears your head...\" The lieutenant steps away from the barbell, letting your recover in peace.",
		"\"Good technique.\" The lieutenant nods with approval.",
		"\"It would be a violation of EPIS safety regulations if the gym was still operating. But it isn't. No one's supposed to come here anymore.\"",
		"\"Weightlifting was never my favourite, either.\" The lieutenant is obviously *handling* you.",
		"\"You're right, the weights may fall off. Better not touch it then.\"",
		"\"It was never my favourite, either.\" The lieutenant is obviously handling you.",
		"\"She shared this with you?\"",
		"\"Did this violent life include drug trafficking?\"",
		"\"I really do. If I didn't, I wouldn't be in the RCM. Take care, sir.\"",
		"\"In the name of *god*, what are you doing?\"",
		"\"Yes. And I also thank you -- for stopping. We have a murder investigation to return to. How about we do that?\"",
		"\"Let's go.\"",
		"The lieutenant closes his eyes and lets slip a loud, long sigh.",
		"The lieutenant steps in: \"We have a credible lead, sir. Someone on this roundabout is waiting for a bulk shipment from the harbour -- to load it on their lorry and drive it to Jamrock.\"",
		"\"What else do you know about her?\"",
		"\"Yes, people get that you are *the law*. You really don't have to keep saying it.\"",
		"\"Yes -- but do continue. You were asking about the strike.\"",
		"\"Ah, yes. From the Wild Pines....\" He takes a note. \"We'll meet her soon enough, I'm sure.\"",
		"\"It wasn't the local Union muscle, by the way.\"",
		"\"We can't just *let it go*. It's part of a police investigation.\"",
		"He turns to the man before you leave. \"Thank you for your cooperation, sir. I know it was hard. But you did the right thing.\"",
		"\"Okay.\" The lieutenant's face betrays little reaction. \"But do continue. You were asking about the strike.\"",
		"\"Yes. And I also thank you -- for *stopping*.\" He looks at you. \"We have a drug investigation to return to. How about we do that?\"",
		"\"The other drivers would have to tow it, or break in, to get the machines moving.\" He nods.",
		"\"I don't think you understand how that joke goes, but -- do continue. You were asking about the strike.\"",
		"\"It won't come to that. We won't pursue her on this. This is information only.\"",
		"The lieutenant throws you a quick glance.",
		"\"All right. That's enough sharing details about the investigation for one day.\"",
		"\"What colour hair?\"",
		"\"What else do you know about her?\"",
		"\"The RCM is a self-managing organization that operates on donations. We promote our own leaders. It would be like striking against your own... mother.\"",
		"\"All right. That's enough sharing details. Let's go.\"",
		"\"Entrapment is where a law officer gets a person to commit a criminal offence they otherwise wouldn't commit. Often through some trickery or fraud.\"",
		"The lieutenant looks at you in silence, a curious look in his eyes, nodding slightly.",
		"\"When did she leave?\"",
		"\"Everyone understands you're *the law*. That's why you have that insignia on your arm. So you don't have to keep saying it.\"",
		"\"A-ha.\" The lieutenant looks at you with his usual lithic mask of a face.",
		"\"Oh-kay.\" The lieutenant stares at you, his visage unflinching.",
		"The lieutenant is doing his best to ignore your behaviour.",
		"The lieutenant is tapping his foot, but you can't tell if it's a habitual tic or impatience.",
		"The lieutenant is jolted to attention by your sudden outburst. \"Huh? Take what?\"",
		"The lieutenant is jolted awake by your furious cursing. \"What's going on with you?\"",
		"The lieutenant coughs sharply, then whispers: \"Do we really need to do this? I think not.\"",
		"\"Huh, interesting. A communard.\"",
		"\"A communard. One of the leftist revolutionaries in the Antecentennial Revolution.\"",
		"\"Hmm. Good luck finding people who'd want to play as communards.\"",
		"\"It is not. The communards are not a part of the game setting... I guess someone misplaced it during the packaging process.\"",
		"\"The figurine is not a part of the Wirrâl game setting... I guess someone misplaced it during the packaging process.\"",
		"The lieutenant shrugs. \"I have a feeling the figurines are more there to set the scene than anything else.\"",
		"The lieutenant coughs sharply, then whispers: \"Let's not. Defrauding small business owners is not our *thing*.\"",
		"He nods toward the staircase. \"Come on, let's go down.\"",
		"\"It must be an electronic lock. You will have to get Garte, the cafeteria manager, to open it first -- after you've paid for the night.\"",
		"\"Just a moment. We should talk about our progress on the investigation. Let's go out to the balcony.\"",
		"\"I would advise against that. It's already late, and you won't find cheaper accommodation in the vicinity.\"",
		"The lieutenant purses his lips. \"Admirable form. Now come on, let's go down.\"",
		"The lieutenant looks on impassively. \"Even if you could break down the door, all you would get is another bill.\"",
		"He nods. \"Yes, we both need to get proper rest tonight.\"",
		"\"Just a moment. You had some questions earlier, I believe, and, besides, we should discuss our progress on the investigation. Let's go out to the balcony.\"",
		"\"Our investigation does not at present require for anyone to go undercover. Let's drop this discussion and go settle your debt with the manager.\"",
		"The lieutenant looks at you with a mixture of pity and weariness. \"Come on, let's go down.\"",
		"The lieutenant looks at you with a mixture of pity and weariness. \"Come on, let's go down.\"",
		"\"I'll wait outside to give you some time and privacy to check out your new living arrangement. But just so you know...\"",
		"\"After we're done with the day, I'll still be staying in the Whirling-in-Rags for the night. We'll meet in front of the shack in the morning.\"",
		"\"I'll be sleeping in my room in the Whirling. We'll meet in front of the shack in the morning.\"",
		"\"Good night, officer. We'll meet in front of the shack in the morning.\"",
		"\"I'm afraid we don't have time for rest stops right now, officer. We should really get back to the Whirling.\"",
		"\"Good night.\" He smiles: \"And try not to break the case without me.\"",
		"\"I guess I can come along for a quick stroll...\" The lieutenant looks at you apologetically. \"I mean if the ma'am insists, of course.\"",
		"\"You've graduated to *Lawbringer* now?\"",
		"\"Can we maybe ask your twins about that place -- before we go? Would that be all right?\"",
		"\"No, ma'am. We have no quarrel with sunny days.\"",
		"\"That's all we have time for right now anyway.\" The lieutenant looks at you sympathetically. \"Come back here in June and see how you feel about it then. It's not like it's going anywhere.\"",
		"\"Of course, ma'am. It's only for a day or two -- official police business.\"",
		"\"I think I might,\" the lieutenant mumbles under his breath.",
		"\"Very recently, over the past few days. She might have arrived on Friday.\"",
		"\"Let's call it a walk.\" The lieutenant adjusts his glasses and looks at you apologetically. \"I will join you, if the ma'am insists.\"",
		"\"Living with the construction noise is going to be a challenge.\"",
		"\"There was an exchange of fire on Rue de Saint-Ghislaine. It's nothing to be worried about, ma'am.\"",
		"The lieutenant looks at you almost gently. \"Yes. That is a pity. But for now let's focus on the things we *do* get to do. Like the murder investigation for example.\"",
		"The lieutenant shakes his head again.",
		"\"It's not serious. He'll be okay.\"",
		"\"It absolutely does not,\" the lieutenant quietly interjects. \"We are *not* going to look for him.\"",
		"\"Who *has* been there?\"",
		"\"Officer...\" The lieutenant has discreetly taken a few steps back. \"I thought we had a walk of our own in mind. One that results in a solved murder investigation?\"",
		"\"What?\"",
		"\"It'll float.\"",
		"\"Let's go.\" He whispers.",
		"\"Fine.\" He gives you resigned shrug. \"Let's *blast* Sad FM then.\"",
		"\"Fine. Why not?\" He shrugs.",
		"\"He's from Graad -- a Kojko,\" the lieutenant informs you.",
		"\"We speak *Suresne*. There is no such thing as the *Revacholian language*,\" he sighs. \"But don't worry, your message remained clear.\"",
		"\"I don't think he understands, officer... We need to find some other way to make ourselves clear.\"",
		"\"Speak Revacholian?\" The lieutenant raises his eyebrows.",
		"\"Doesn't matter... I don't think he understood us anyway. He wouldn't be smiling if he did.\"",
		"\"Okay, so it's vodka that keeps the men happy and in good spirits.\" He nods. \"Clever move by the Union.\"",
		"\"Why am *I* the corpse?!\" He turns his eyes to the cook, who gives you both a big bright smile.",
		"\"Good thing he didn't understand a word of your stupidity,\" he concludes.",
		"\"What are you doing?!\"",
		"\"Okay, we have our answer. It won't fit. We need a bigger fridge.\"",
		"\"Your call, detective. Again, I only have *exactly* one every night.\" He blows a steady stream of smoke.",
		"\"The Moralist International are the world's largest political organization.\" He pulls on his cigarette. \"You know who they are. They have been running this place after the Revolution failed.\"",
		"\"We couldn't conduct an interview with Evrart Claire because you refused to take a seat.\"",
		"\"We didn't get to meet Evrart Claire, but we did get into the harbour. It'll be easier to reach him tomorrow.\"",
		"\"Change? No, not exactly. But I think all of us at some point imagine what our lives might have been had we been something else.\"",
		"\"Getting her to really talk to us took fantastic interpersonal skills and perseverance. Good work, detective.\"",
		"\"No, we didn't. It's very important that we do it tomorrow latest.\" He breathes out. A billow of silver smoke.",
		"\"What do they believe in? They are Dolorians. They *believe* they continue the humanist project set forth by Her Innocence Dolores Dei four centuries ago. Others say they're just technocrats.\"",
		"\"It's *incredibly* hard. Human beings are...\" He shakes his head. \"But we are in control. And it's worth it. The organization works. Our systems work. If they didn't, this city would disintegrate.\"",
		"\"They're quite limited, actually -- the power officers of the Revachol Citizens Militia exercise most *frequently* is imposing fines of up to 1000 reál for offences, in accordance with an interdepartmental schedule.\"",
		"\"You can't. Those who don't show up become fugitives though, and have fewer legal rights when they are eventually caught. It's about power projection. Thus far they seem to mostly show up.\"",
		"\"It's not my job to evaluate your methodology, officer. I'm just going through the facts. As for the interviews...\"",
		"He raises his eyebrows. \"Right. As for the interviews...\"",
		"\"Being sober tends to help with precision. Anyway, we performed a field autopsy on the victim. We didn't learn much, though.\"",
		"\"I look forward to that. As for the interviews...\"",
		"\"Well...\" He frowns. \"We will have to work through that.\"",
		"\"I have a feeling that she knows how dangerous the situation really is. We *have* to get her to talk to us.\" He frowns.",
		"\"Now then... we should talk about the investigation -- but I also feel you're a bit *hazy* on the RCM. Our role here, our rights. Our *jurisdiction* basically.\" He lights a cigarette.",
		"\"That seems unwise to me, but it's too late for an all-out political debate.\" He purses his lips.",
		"\"We met Evrart Claire, but didn't conduct a full interview. So that's one for the to-do list...\"",
		"\"I still feel like we missed something, but maybe the boys in Processing will surprise us. We still have work to do at the crime scene.\"",
		"\"Where shall we begin? We should talk about the investigation first and foremost, but I also remember you wanting to discuss the RCM?\" He lights a cigarette.",
		"\"We are permitted to use whatever force we deem necessary. Even lethal.\"",
		"\"You got him to talk to you about the Union and even his drug trade, but he wouldn't talk to you about the murder without having you do a favour for him first.\"",
		"\"Mhm, including Evrart Claire. A daunting adversary if there ever was one.\"",
		"\"Either way, we'll have to approach him again. Anyway...\" The lieutenant raises his eyebrows.",
		"\"Alright, but -- and, forgive me, this is just something I have to ask -- if you have shoes, then *why aren't you wearing them*?\"",
		"\"We don't convict. We arrest and send them to Coalition Government courts -- in Couron and La Delta. The prosecution works off our testimonies. And records -- which is why it's paramount to keep them.\" He taps on his coat pocket -- where he keep his notes.",
		"\"Then you will *adore* Martinaise. For many of these people -- the Union especially -- vigilantes is precisely what we are. Personally, I don't enjoy it much.\" He looks at the roundabout.",
		"\"We weren't able to find the Union leader, Evrart Claire, much less interview him. So that's on the to-do list for tomorrow.\"",
		"\"*Not* a good position to be in, by the way. Internal Affairs handles these cases thoroughly -- by cross-examining you for inconsistencies. It is hard to *cover* for anyone. Which is for the best.\"",
		"\"Precinct 41 is known for... a higher-than-average rate of police violence.\"",
		"\"And the Moralintern more broadly, but yes.\" His gaze is absently fixed on a window below that just went dark.",
		"\"The Coalition Government and the Moralintern more broadly.\"",
		"\"Being sober tends to help with precision. But, moving on to the interviews...\"",
		"\"I look forward to that. As for the interviews...\"",
		"The air outside is brisk, the lieutenant is silent for a moment. He listens to the traffic hum, then...",
		"\"Well phrased.\" He nods and breathes out. \"I understand answering to foreign powers doesn't sit well with immigrant-bashing -- but without the MI we would be common vigilantes. That's just the way it is.\"",
		"\"Silence -- a great comment to such a conundrum.\"",
		"\"Our inspection *could* have been more thorough -- as it always can -- but we have some leads we can follow up on.\"",
		"\"I still feel like we're missing something. And there's still work to do at the crime scene too...\"",
		"\"It's impressive, especially for a man your age -- and in *those* heels...\" He nods thoughtfully, tapping his finger on his cigarette.",
		"\"You got him to talk to you about both the Union and the murder, so we're definitely making progress there.\"",
		"\"In addition, we got that body *down* from the tree. We still have to perform the autopsy, though. And there's more work to be done at the crime scene.\"",
		"\"Although I see the appeal, being thus adrift interferes with performing one's duties. Moving on...\"",
		"\"But let's talk about Joyce Messier for a moment.\"",
		"\"Alright, but -- and, forgive me, this has been bothering me since this morning -- how have you managed to run around all day *wearing no shoes*?\"",
		"\"Alright, but -- and, forgive me, this has been bothering me since this morning -- how have you managed to run around all day *wearing only one shoe*?\"",
		"\"Well, there seems to be at least one shoe further down the balcony.\" He points with his cigarette. \"Perhaps you can collect it when we're done talking.\"",
		"\"It would have been even better if we had been able to examine the bullet... but what really worries me is that the body is still decomposing in the yard.\"",
		"\"I'm sure. Well, we conducted an interview with Evrart Claire.\"",
		"\"I hope your confidence will translate into results, officer.\"",
		"He studies you with mild concern. \"Just don't get carried away. At any rate, we still have to perform the autopsy. And there's more work to be done at the crime scene.\"",
		"\"It's not my job to evaluate your methodology, officer. I'm just going through the facts. As for the interviews...\"",
		"\"But the years have changed that. I don't know *what* I believe in now....\" He thinks, then changes his mind. \"No. I believe in the RCM. That's enough for me.\"",
		"\"It's our fault for leaving this place to the dogs. To the Union. To the company. Not daring to come here more often. This place has fallen between the cracks. The jurisdictions of our two Precincts.\"",
		"\"They're a union of centre-left and centre-right parties across the Reál Belt. Our Coalition Government is just one of its many projects. They also run the ICP, EPIS... most inter-governmental organizations in the world.\"",
		"\"Then you shot him in the chest, which... wasn't ideal. And we still have to get him down from the tree.\"",
		"\"The RCM's primary role is to ensure safety. We're not really supposed to play any part in the economic structure of Revachol.\"",
		"\"Being sober also tends to help with precision. But, moving on to the interviews...\"",
		"\"But, despite your misanthropy, we conducted an interview with Evrart Claire. No small task.\"",
		"\"I'm glad we can agree on that, at least.\"",
		"\"As for the interviews...\"",
		"\"Moving on to the interviews...\"",
		"\"Claire also helped you... how should I say? *Remember your name*? That's a relief.\"",
		"\"I have a feeling Joyce knows how dangerous the situation really is. We *have* to get her to talk to us.\" He purses his lips.",
		"\"Well, there seems to be a shoe that is a match to the one you're wearing further down the balcony.\" He points with his cigarette. \"Perhaps you can collect it when we're done talking.\"",
		"\"Those are some stylish shoes too, by the way. Those loafers. Must be *hard* to run in those like you do.\" He smiles suddenly.",
		"\"Be sentimental, if you like. Either way -- the Moralintern leases us the right to keep the peace in this city. And they will take it away if we misuse it.\"",
		"\"Interesting question. It's a blue forget-me-not. Their motto is: Love, Compassion, Self-Discipline. I think you can gauge what they *want* you to think of them from that.\"",
		"\"Well, we didn't even look at the body...\" The lieutenant raises his eyebrows.",
		"\"Yes.\" He pauses. \"The last time was four years ago.\"",
		"He sighs. \"We're both doing our best under the circumstances. Just... don't drink tonight, please. As for the interviews...\"",
		"\"As for the interviews...\"",
		"He raises his eyebrows. \"Right. We still have to perform the autopsy, though. And there's more work to be done at the crime scene.\"",
		"He sighs. \"We're both doing our best under the circumstances. Just... don't drink tonight, please. As for the interviews...\"",
		"\"Yes. The international community's mission in Revachol -- and the Moralintern more broadly.\"",
		"\"The Moralintern are a fact. I try not to have opinions on facts -- until they change. And,\" he looks at the city below, \"it doesn't look like that's about to happen.\"",
		"He nods. \"Sadly, it is what we already are to the people of Martinaise. Most of them at least, especially the Union -- vigilantes. I expect our job here to prove quite challenging.\" He looks at the roundabout.",
		"The dying lights of the city shimmer below -- slowly, like luminous clouds, they pass on his lenses. The lieutenant looks at his slim cigarette, contemplating the next drag.",
		"\"Officers of the RCM have been known to take bribes of less than the prescribed fine amount.\" He frowns. \"It undermines trust in the RCM.\"",
		"\"I look forward to that. As for the interviews...\"",
		"\"I have a feeling Joyce knows how dangerous the situation really is. We *have* to get her to talk to us.\" He purses his lips.",
		"\"It's impressive, to say the least. For a man your age...\" He nods thoughtfully, tapping his finger on his cigarette.",
		"\"If you want to smoke like a rock and roll star, that's up to you. Again, I only have *exactly* one every night.\" He blows a steady stream of smoke.",
		"\"Yes. I *did* -- when I was younger. In my twenties I considered myself a moralist. *A blue forget-me-not, a piece of the sky*,\" he quotes. \"They're not all that bad.\"",
		"\"Do you?\" The lieutenant arches his brow, then pulls on his cigarette. It's a slim white thing in his fingers.",
		"\"It's our fault for leaving this place to the dogs. To the Union. To the company. Not daring to come here more often. It's like I told you -- this place is an orphan. Fallen between the cracks...\"",
		"\"Probably not,\" he says quietly. \"Anyway, positive change happens slowly. We never really get to see the impact of our actions.\"",
		"\"We conducted an interview with Evrart Claire.\"",
		"\"I still feel like we missed something, but at least the corpse has been refrigerated. There's still work to be done at the crime scene, though.\"",
		"\"You got him to talk to you about the Union, but he wouldn't talk to you about the murder without having you do a favour for him first.\"",
		"\"But we performed a thorough search of the premises of the crime scene. That's great.\"",
		"\"It enabled us to perform a field autopsy on the victim. We didn't learn much, though.\"",

		"\"Being sober also tends to help with precision. Anyway, we performed a field autopsy on the victim. We didn't learn much, though.\"",
		"\"And there's still work to be done at the crime scene. Now, for the interviews...\" He takes a deep drag and looks at the city.",
		"\"Your personhood was never in doubt, officer. Moving on...\"",
		"\"But let's move on to the Wild Pines rep.\"",
		"\"Suit yourself.\" The lieutenant knocks some ash from his cigarette. \"But you should probably consider wearing them anyway.\"",
		"\"A historic figure? The author of the modern age?\" He thinks. \"You will have to look elsewhere for opinions. The subject of humanism is too abstract for me.\"",
		"\"Now, as for interviews -- my list of people to talk to here in Martinaise, I mean...\" He takes a deep drag and looks at the city.",
		"\"We interviewed Joyce Messier, the Wild Pines rep, and learned a lot -- none of it very *good news* for us or Martinaise, but...\" He gives you a quick nod of acknowledgement and approval.",
		"\"We didn't talk to the Wild Pines rep. We really must do that tomorrow.\"",
		"\"Yes, although indirectly, as citizens can always request records from their local station.\"",
		"\"Unfortunately, the body is still decomposing in the yard. We should take care of that as soon as possible.\"",
		"\"In addition, we got that body *down* from the tree. *And* performed a field autopsy on the victim. We didn't learn much, though.\"",
		"\"Spoken like a revolutionary, not a cop. But hypothetical aside -- in Martinaise we already *are* vigilantes. At least the Union thinks so. I expect our job here to prove quite challenging.\" He looks at the roundabout.",
		"\"We can arrest people, of course, but, rather than bringing someone in directly, it's preferable to serve a *Station Call* slip. It prevents confusion and overcrowding.\"",
		"\"Perhaps. But Precinct 41 is known for... a higher-than-average rate of kills.\" He raises his eyebrows.",
		"He looks at you with an unreadable expression. \"What if this murder is a portent? As for the interviews...\"",
		"\"On this occasion, I must agree. At any rate, your shot enabled us to perform a field autopsy on the victim. We didn't learn much, though.\"",
		"He sighs. \"One doesn't need to like the people one is interviewing. Indeed, it's better if you don't.\"",

		"\"Indeed.\" He pauses. \"We *have* to get Messier to talk to us. I have a feeling she knows how dangerous the situation really is. But we also have to be careful about what we share with her.\"",
		"\"It's probably more honest, yes. Either way, the Moralintern leases us the right to keep the peace in this city. And they will take it away if we misuse it.\"",
		"\"The body is still hanging from that tree, which is... unfortunate. And there's still *much* to do at the crime scene.\"",
		"\"Above all, though... today was exhausting. What's with all the *running*? You run a lot. Is that a standard Precinct 41 practice?\"",
		"\"You really got him talking, and now we know a lot about local politics, including Claire's drug trade, and also have some viable suspects.\"",
		"\"You got him to talk to you about the Union and even his drug trade, but he wouldn't talk to you about the murder.\"",
		"\"You got him to talk to you about the Union, but not the murder.\"",
		"\"He wasn't particularly forthcoming with useful information, however.\"",
		"\"And there's still much to do at the crime scene too. We didn't search it thoroughly enough.\"",

		"\"Unfortunately, the body is still decomposing in the yard. We should take care of that as soon as possible.\"",
		"\"Moving on...\"",
		"\"You mean this?\" The light of his cigarette illuminates a fleeting smile. \"This isn't cool -- it's an unnecessary trial of will. And unhealthy.\" He flicks the ash.",
		"\"We run this city. West of the river is RCM land.\" He looks at the dark silhouette of the equestrian monument cutting into the night sky.",
		"\"*And* you managed to locate and pull out the bullet. So we can get ballistics, make of the gun -- all this is invaluable.\"",

		"\"We are in what is called the *twilight of international law*. The laws we claim to enforce come from the MI. Without them, we are simply vigilantes.\"",
		"\"Then you shot the body down, which was...\" He pauses, searching for the right word. \"...quite the shot.\"",
		"\"Moreover, you found that the hanged man wasn't just hanged -- he was also shot. That was some *excellent* detective work.\"",
		"\"We met Evrart Claire, but you left the conversation abruptly before we could really interview him.\"",
		"\"Yeah, it's getting very cold now. Let's go.\" He puts out the stub of his cigarette and looks to the door.",

		"\"That's an improbability -- perhaps even impossibility...\"",
		"\"The RCM was formed by the Coalition Government to restore order in the International Zone after the Revolution. So we did. Now we attempt to *maintain* that order, no more, no less.\" His gaze is absently fixed on a window below that just went dark.",

		"\"And one more thing...\" He pulls the black plastic over the dead man's face, then looks at you. \"This was *very* good work, detective.\"",
		"\"Looks like we can get to work at once. The Union muscle turned up.\" He points to the mess hall doors. \"They look rowdy. We should talk to them.\"",
		"\"That would just escalate tensions. No captain would sign off on it. Solving one murder isn't worth a conflict between the RCM and the Débardeurs' Union.\"",
		"\"I've got some good news.\" The lieutenant smiles. \"I took care of the body. The thought of him decomposing in my MC wouldn't let me sleep.\"",
		"\"And the big one,\" he squints his eyes, studying the men in the mess hall, \"must be Hardie himself...\"",
		"\"Men who drink beer for breakfast. I have no doubt these are the Hardie boys Evrart told us about, the ones who *keep the peace* around here.\"",
		"\"Everything points to the Dockworkers' Union: the tracks in the mud, the circumstances in Martinaise, my preliminary information...\"",
		"\"Which may, of course, all be wrong. But we still need to talk to them -- and it won't be easy.\"",
		"\"I'm just glad he's gone. We have other matters to attend to.\"",
		"\"One loose thread less to worry about -- and one big problem to replace it.\" He crosses something out.",
		"\"Well, he's in processing now. We have other matters to attend to.\"",
		"\"I'm just glad he's gone. We have other matters to attend to.\"",
		"\"We can't be sure of course -- Evrart may have lied to us. He definitely has an agenda of his own. Either way, we need to interview them. And it won't be easy.\"",
		"He points to the mess hall doors. \"The Union muscle finally turned up, and they look rowdy. We need to talk to them.\"",
		"\"...that's not *a lot* of things. We should have dug up more yesterday. Still, we need to talk to them. And it won't be easy.\"",
		"\"They're in no hurry to leave -- they think they own the place... Anyway, I leave that choice to you. Whatever you decide is fine by me.\"",
		"\"I completely forgot.\" He looks at his notes. \"Sorry, I had a rough night's sleep. It's them, by the looks of it -- loud and nasty, just like the manager said.\"",
		"\"In fact, even the *death* of two detectives might not warrant an all-out war. So let's keep a cool head, okay?\"",
		"\"Looks like we can get to work at once. The Union muscle turned up.\" He points to the mess hall doors. \"They look rowdy. We should talk to them.\"",
		"\"A lot of things point to the Dockworkers' Union: the circumstances in Martinaise, my preliminary information. Hmm, actually...\"",
		"\"Well, he's in processing now. We have other matters to attend to.\"",
		"\"I mean ungovernable. Martinaise isn't exactly enthusiastic about the RCM being here. They prefer to be *policed* by the Union -- these men here...\"",
		"\"This is clearly the Union's *peacekeeping* force Evrart told us about. The one he said hanged our victim.\"",
		"\"One more thing before we do...\" He glances at the booth again. \"We don't have to talk to them immediately. We can walk right past them, continue with our business.\"",
		"\"Everything points to the Dockworkers' Union: the *belt* used for hanging him, the circumstances in Martinaise, my preliminary information...\"",
		"\"Men who drink beer for breakfast? There's talk of an armed wing of the Union called *the Hardie boys*, who are responsible for said *policing*. I think it's them.\"",
		"The lieutenant does not pursue the subject further, looking out the bathroom window instead.",
		"\"Right. Thank you for this information.\" He seems satisfied. \"Should we go?\"",
		"\"Interesting. That's used for diamorphine overdoses...\" The lieutenant nods -- then looks at the door.",
		"\"There's always a price...\" He looks out the window.",
		"\"Right.\" He seems satisfied with your answer. \"I can see how that can be useful.\"",
		"\"Mhm,\" the lieutenant nods. \"She certainly had her priorities straight when she was packing.\"",
		"\"Hmh.\" He lets out a little pensive hum... \"That's what I thought. Let's go?\"",
		"\"I was just curious. Anyway let's go.\"",
		"The lieutenant glances at the rows of pills -- then at the door.",
		"The lieutenant looks toward the door as if he didn't see you pilfer that sweet Preptide.",
		"\"Of course you were.\" He nods. \"How does that work anyway?\"",
		"\"Hmh.\" He lets out a little pensive hum. \"Thought so. Let's go?\"",
		"\"I thought so.\" He seems satisfied with the answer. \"Should we go?\"",
		"\"An opioid receptor antagonist. It's used for diamorphine overdoses.\"",
		"\"Yes, but... did you know you don't *have* radiation sickness?\"",
		"\"Preptide -- a euphemism for pharmaceutical amphetamine. Prescription speed.\"",
		"\"I always took you for more of a drunk than a chemical abuser,\" he says as though it's self-evident. \"Anyway.\"",
		"\"Maybe I should?\" He lets out a little pensive hum, rubbing his shoulder...",
		"\"Amphetamine -- does it make you a better detective?\"",
		"\"Anything of note?\" he asks in a lowered voice.",
		"The lieutenant *tries* to keep his eyes on the door, but the Preptide bottle sounds like a rattlesnake -- it's basically a percussion instrument that you're stuffing into your pocket.",
		"\"It may be -- but I asked if it makes you better at your work?\"",
		"\"Doesn't the... pupils and the gurning jaw, the sweating... doesn't it become tiring after a while?\"",
		"\"Right. I'll give it some thought.\" He seems satisfied with your answer. \"Should we go?\"",
		"\"Hmh.\" He lets out a little pensive hum. \"Thought so. Let's go?\"",
		"\"You?\" He looks at you. \"I wouldn't worry about that.\"",
		"\"The big deal?\" The lieutenant rolls his eyes. \"I guess we really do come from different upbringings...\"",
		"\"I can see that, but do you have to do it where everyone can see you?\" He looks shocked.",
		"\"Well... uh... don't!\" The lieutenant looks truly shocked.",
		"\"WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!\" The lieutenant jumps away from you.",
		"\"Then why are you elbow deep in your pants like...\" He suddenly stops as if realizing he doesn't want to hear the answer. \"Never mind, officer. Carry on.\"",
		"\"Really? It seems more like a personal hygiene thing.\" He leans even more away from you. \"But let's not delve deeper.\"",
		"\"Have you no self control?\" Then realizing the naivete of the question he looks at the ground. \"Please spare me this sight.\"",
		"\"It's okay.\" The lieutenant jots something down in his notebook. \"It was a loose end and you're tying it up now.\"",
		"The lieutenant sighs without looking up from his notes.",
		"\"Using a standard form, officer.\" The lieutenant pulls out a sheet of carbon copy paper, scribbles something on it, then tears out the bottom page and hands it to Gary.",
		"\"The weather vane has turned,\" the lieutenant remarks with a smirk. \"He cannot be un-turned.\"",
		"\"Disgraced?\" The lieutenant raises his eyebrows and looks up. \"No need for the histrionics, sir. It was, after all, just a trash container.\"",
		"\"Great.\" The lieutenant mumbles. \"First the sandwich, now a pie...\"",
		"The lieutenant leans in confidentially. \"You wouldn't be able to hear if he were wearing anal beads,\" he whispers.",
		"\"At any rate,\" he gestures toward Gary as though he were presenting a work of art, \"*this* is that racist.\"",
		"\"It's 50 reál,\" he explains. \"You're getting off easy. In return, we expect *information*. You have questions to answer, sir.\"",
		"\"Please excuse my colleague's humour. Working this murder case is taking a toll on us both. You don't *quite* have to answer that -- yet.\"",
		"The lieutenant raises his eyebrows slightly and takes out his notebook.",
		"The lieutenant raises his eyebrows slightly and takes out his notebook.",
		"Deep satisfying rumble runs through your small intestine. It feels affirming.",
		"The lieutenant looks up at you, almost sadly.",
		"\"So you *do* know something about it?\"",
		"\"Do you remember how when we met Measurehead and I said the next racist will be the *really* good one?\"",
		"\"Well...\" He gestures toward Gary as though he were presenting a work of art. \"*This* is that racist.\"",
		"\"No -- you've got *explaining* to do.\" The lieutenant's tone is icy.",
		"The lieutenant looks up at you, sighs, and goes back to his notes.",
		"\"We don't really do that around here.\"",
		"\"Right, it was just *civic duty*,\" the lieutenant remarks drolly.",
		"\"Right.\" It does not look like he thinks you're right. \"Anyway, that's for the cryptozoologists to figure out now.\" He adds, for clarity: \"*We're* not cryptozoologists -- we're cops.\"",
		"Neither does the lieutenant. He just raises his collar -- it's cold out, as always.",
		"\"Of course. Noted.\" He looks at you, incredulously, as you place the trap back in the reeds.",
		"\"Big surprise.\" The lieutenant grins mirthlessly. \"Anyway -- one down, three to go.\"",
		"\"Yes. Like a cat, or another teenage psychopath.\"",
		"\"Okay. But after that we get back to our own assignments. We've done a thorough survey of the coast now -- just running around is no longer useful.\"",
		"\"Always up for a good jog -- otherwise, would I still be *on* this case with *you*?\" He smiles and raises his collar. It's windy.",
		"The lieutenant's gaze follows yours and lingers on the reeds, the sand, the water beyond. Then he turns back to you expectantly.",
		"\"Yup. The next one has a *crab* trapped in it.\" He raises his collar -- it's windy. \"These are just crab traps, you do realize?\"",
		"The lieutenant studies the trap with you. \"Well, the bait worked on *something*. This doesn't mean it was a reed-monster, though. Unless you see one in there? I just see an empty trap...\"",
		"He purses his lips. \"Perhaps our cryptozoologists have competition in the form of an actual entomologist? Or someone else is sabotaging them? I could present more theories, but then I would be taking this on as a case -- which I'm *not*.\"",
		"\"Good, good. We should be courteous and tell the cryptozoologists that one of their traps was empty, but then we can get back to *our* assignment here.\"",
		"\"Good. Now that's done. When can we get to our impending apocalypse of a murder investigation?\"",
		"\"Of course. Noted.\" He looks at you, incredulously, as you place the trap back in the reeds.",
		"\"No-no. I'm fine. I didn't mean to complain, it's just...\" He's short-winded. The sentence ends there.",
		"\"I'm just...\" he breathes out. \"Glad we haven't found some poor cat trapped in one of these.\"",
		"The lieutenant stretches his back.",
		"\"I'm beginning to feel... somewhat sorry for the little guys.\"",
		"\"Another empty trap,\" the lieutenant takes a note -- more out of habit than duty.",
		"\"I meant no offence, just...\" The lieutenant doesn't know how to finish the sentence. He looks at you, putting the trap back on the ground.",
		"He stops you. \"Don't answer that. It was a rhetorical question.\"",
		"\"Surely,\" he repeats and looks at the sea, then at you putting the trap back on the ground. \"Anyway, the air is nice and fresh here...\"",
		"\"Empty as all of them...\" he pants. \"*One* more of these and we're done...\" His face is red from the cold sea air. He crouches to catch his breath.",
		"\"We did *sort of* promise to tell them, didn't we...\" He seems to regret the fact.",
		"\"No you weren't.\" He looks at the sea, then you -- laying the trap back down on the ground.",
		"\"No you weren't.\" He looks at the sea, then you -- laying the trap back down on the ground.",
		"\"I meant no offence, just...\" The lieutenant doesn't know how to finish the sentence. He looks at you, putting the trap back on the ground.",
		"\"Good. Now that's done. When do you think we will return to our impending apocalypse of a murder investigation?\"",
		"\"Yup. The next one has a *crab* trapped in it.\" He raises his collar -- it's windy. \"These are just crab traps, you do realize?\"",
		"\"I'm beginning to feel... somewhat sorry for them.\"",

		"\"Good. Now that's done. When do you think we will return to our impending apocalypse of a murder investigation?\"",
		"That's all it takes. There is no room for hesitation. The lieutenant moves, like a spring unloaded. He grabs the gun from your bloody hand and fires behind him.",
		"\"Stay with me!\" The lieutenant pushes down on your wound, hard. \"You hear me?! Stay awake! Look at me!\"",
		"From the corner of your eye you see the lieutenant raise his pistol -- and aim it at Ruud.",
		"\"Stay with me!\" You feel burning hot tears streaming from your eyes.",
		"\"No,\" the lieutenant says firmly. \"We have to step in. This is not going to end well if we don't...\"",
		"\"Ssshhhhh....\" The lieutenant raises his left hand.",
		"Like a pillow, he falls on you. Cold nylon and blood slumped on you, as the lights go out. All the lights. The last thing you hear is the sound of his spectacles landing on the pavement next to you.",
		"To your left you hear the lieutenant cock his gun.",
		"\"Uh, what?\" The lieutenant quickly glances at you.",
		"\"Stay with me!\" You feel burning hot tears streaming from your eyes.",
		"There is no room for hesitation. The lieutenant turns around and fires, his body falling on yours in the course of the motion...",
		"\"You're bleeding out!\" Nothing. Darkness, blurring lights of pain. Out of it, a silhouette emerges -- crouching over you. A familiar voice, filled with urgency and fear.",
		"\"My plan is not to get killed.\" He puts his hand on his holster. \"But we have to intervene.\"",
		"But you can't. It's so hard. Your eyelids grow heavy and the sounds ever more distant. And a cold comes over you. The lieutenant, too, is somewhere far away. Almost gone... when suddenly! You sense something behind him...",
		"\"Stay with me!\" You feel burning hot tears streaming from your eyes.",
		"A big pillow falls on you. Cold nylon and blood. Slumped on you as the lights go out. All the lights. And the sounds. Of the world. Disappear.",
		"That's all it takes. There is no room for hesitation. The lieutenant moves, like a spring unloaded. He grabs the gun from your bloody hand and fires behind him.",
		"\"If this turns into a firefight, we should take him out first.\" He nods.",
		"There is no room for hesitation. The lieutenant turns around and fires, his body falling on yours in the course of the motion...",
		"\"Fuck, she was right... That must be the *third* mercenary...\"",
		"\"... the mercenary tribunal.\" The lieutenant nods.",
		"To your left, you hear the lieutenant cock his gun.",
		"\"Fuck, there are *three* of them... I was hoping there would be... less.\" The lieutenant points to the helmeted figure.",
		"\"Fuck, there's a third one... How did we miss something like this?\" The lieutenant points to the helmeted figure.",
		"\"God, please...\" the lieutenant says quietly, without trembling. He aims, face pale...",
		"He just shakes his head, still crouched over you. You hear a distant gunshot. Velvety smooth -- a red circle has appeared on the lieutenant's jacket. It's growing fast.",
		"\"Yes! Keep talking!\" The lieutenant pushes down on your wound, hard. \"You hear me?! Stay awake!\"",
		"\"Yes! Keep talking!\" The lieutenant pushes down on your wound, hard. \"Stay awake! Look at me!\"",
		"\"Are you sure? There are things we still need to do here...\" He looks at the ruined flak tower on the cliffside.",
		"\"Let's. We're done here,\" he says, adjusting his glasses as he looks out over the water.",
		"The lieutenant throws you an embarrassed glance as you consider the washbasin.",
		"\"My guess is it started its journey from the plaza, where it backed through the fence.\"",
		"With his lips puckered the lieutenant lets out a beautiful melodic trill that puts even the Insulindic thrush to shame.",
		"\"Detective,\" he says almost gently. \"We *don't*. A rescue operation really isn't viable at this point.\"",
		"\"Well...\" The lieutenant shrugs. \"Life has a way of pulling the rug from under your feet. But things can only go up from here.\"",
		"\"Just keep at it, it will come to you.\"",
		"\"You can still whistle,\" the lieutenant says with a smile. \"Besides, the night is always darkest before the dawn.\"",
		"\"I'm afraid so, yes. It looks like you drove your police motor carriage into the sea, after you jumped across the canal.\"",
		"The lieutenant must think it's rather funny. He smiles and quickly turns away.",
		"The lieutenant looks at his wristwatch. \"The world turns as fast as it wants.\"",
		"\"I think I know now, what my favourite blue thing is.\" He nods. \"Yes, my favourite blue thing is a blue police uniform... or blue police livery.\"",
		"\"I'm sorry, Harry. I'm so sorry.\"",
		"\"Well, not *cheaper*. This motor carriage costs 40,000 reál... but in the long run it stills makes more sense to buy a new machine than try to refurbish this.\"",
		"\"I believe it's following a pattern set millions of years ago by cosmic forces... But I suppose it *could* move quicker, yes.\"",
		"\"Well...\" The lieutenant rubs his chin. \"Historically, leeches have been used to prevent and even cure many ailments...\"",
		"\"The ice hasn't closed around the vehicle yet...\" He leans forward to peek into the cold water. \"My guess is it's been here since last Saturday or Sunday.\"",
		"\"I'm afraid it will have to *be* there like that for many years.\" He looks around. \"Look at it -- parts of it might be salvageable, but overall this machine is a write-off.\"",
		"\"Let's face it, this is a substantial loss to your district's budget.\" He's avoiding your gaze now. \"I mean, my station only has four other vehicles in addition to my Kineema...\"",
		"\"Luckily, I am already a member of an independent organization, and therefore do not have to choose between a rock and a hard place.\"",
		"\"Yes. Forty-one. What do you think it stands for?\"",
		"\"Detective, I've been able to make out the marque ever since we arrived. I find it odd that you haven't. It's a Coupris, Model 40.\" His eyes turn to you.",
		"\"But it could also be,\" he tilts his head and stresses: \"... the number of a police precinct. Precinct 41 -- *your* precinct.\"",
		"The lieutenant gives you a quick glance. Then, still looking straight ahead, he joins you with a higher-pitched and slightly more melodic trill.",
		"\"It appears to be so.\" The lieutenant has a peculiar look in his eyes as he inspects the wreckage.",
		"\"Yes. Quite.\" The lieutenant seems to be inspecting you more closely than the motor carriage.",
		"\"Hmm...\" The lieutenant is staring at the wreck. \"Let me think about it...\"",
		"\"I agree,\" the lieutenant replies, a curious look in his eyes. \"We should *definitely* investigate.\"",
		"\"At least we have a pretty good suspect. If we found your motor carriage in the sea, maybe we'll find her too.\"",
		"\"Yes, yes. Crazy recklessness.\" The lieutenant glances at you. \"I'd say it has been here since last Saturday or Sunday.\"",
		"\"It is indeed.\" The lieutenant nods. \"Or more accurately *was*.\"",
		"\"A precinct, yes!\" He tilts his head and continues in a soft voice. \"A police precinct. Precinct 41 -- *your* precinct.\"",
		"\"There were never any street racers. It was always you. You drove your car in the sea.\"",
		"The lieutenant just shakes his head.",
		"\"No...\" The lieutenant looks at the carriage and then at you. \"Not so daring at all.\"",
		"\"I agree,\" the lieutenant replies, a curious look in his eyes. \"We should *definitely* investigate.\"",
		"\"Actually not a coincidence. The Kineema is the next generation sports edition of the old 'Forty', which was a real work horse. Favoured by the *police* all over the city...\" He raises his finger.",
		"\"Yes, your car is in the sea. Face it so we can start dealing with this.\"",
		"\"Of whom?\" The lieutenant looks sceptical. \"I don't think so. If anything... you were probably drunk.\"",
		"\"People are more valuable than machines.\" He's trying to cheer you up now. \"Training a police officer is even more costly.\"",
		"\"Once again, differences in skin colour are the result of melanin production, liver functions, regional adaptation, and various other factors.\"",
		"\"My guess is it started its journey from the plaza, where it backed through the fence.\"",
		"\"I did not.\" He gives you a blank stare. \"But I'd say it has been here since last Saturday or Sunday.\"",
		"\"Yes, yes. Clearly this is a triumph,\" he remarks dryly. \"I'd say the vehicle has been here since last Saturday or Sunday.\"",
		"The lieutenant adjusts his glasses and doesn't say anything.",
		"\"Yes, yes, it does.\"",
		"\"I don't know. An hour or two tops.\"",
		"\"That is very unlikely,\" the lieutenant replies with a sigh. \"All the electrics are toast. That goes for the electromagnetic steering and brake systems as well.\"",
		"\"No...\" The lieutenant looks at the carriage and then at you. \"Not so daring at all.\"",
		"\"But it could also be,\" he tilts his head and stresses: \"... the number of a police precinct. Precinct 41 -- *your* precinct.\"",
		"\"You'd be *lucky* to find one undamaged component in there...\" He shakes his head. \"In a few months there will be nothing *but* rust left of this vehicle. It'll be cheaper to buy a new one...\"",
		"\"We can still do that,\" the lieutenant says with a smile. \"Besides, the night is always darkest before the dawn.\"",
		"\"I agree,\" the lieutenant replies, his eyes never leave the sunken vehicle. \"We should definitely investigate.\"",
		"\"I agree,\" the lieutenant replies, a curious look in his eyes. \"We should *definitely* investigate.\"",
		"\"I agree,\" the lieutenant replies, a curious look in his eyes. \"We should *definitely* investigate.\"",
		"\"I agree,\" the lieutenant replies, his eyes never leave the sunken vehicle. \"We should definitely investigate.\"",
		"\"That's right. Just keep at it, it will come to you.\"",
		"\"It is a simple and rugged machine, favoured by working men, government offices...\" He pauses to think. \"Firefighters, animal control people. You know, *those* kinds of people.\"",
		"\"Right...\" The lieutenant is looking at you peculiarly. \"*Or* 41 is the number of a police precinct? Your precinct.\"",
		"\"Let's wait for the low tide and see what's inside.\"",
		"\"My dad and mum are both half-Seolite.\"",
		"\"It appears to be so.\" The lieutenant has a peculiar look in his eyes as he inspects the wreckage.",
		"\"Yes. Let's go take a look.\"",
		"\"Well, it isn't. It's you. I'm very sorry.\"",
		"The lieutenant's expression suddenly turns very serious. \"God, I hope so.\"",
		"\"Actually not a coincidence. The Kineema is the next generation sports edition of the 'Forty', which was a real work horse. Favoured by the *police* all over the city.\" His expression is unreadable.",
		"\"There must be a key somewhere,\" the lieutenant says. \"Probably somewhere in the Whirling? It's not *too* important. We can get in and out using the roof door.\"",
		"\"So do I.\" The lieutenant touches the lock. \"It's locked -- and sturdy. The paint job looks old. From *before* the cafeteria.\"",
		"\"It's hardly worth a *title*...\" He looks at the door, then you. \"Anyway, Garte is the person to ask about this -- the cafeteria manager.\"",
		"\"Hardly.\" He looks at the door, then you. \"Anyway, Garte is the person to ask about this -- the cafeteria manager.\"",
		"\"Hmm... Yes, I suppose it's worth seeing if we can get in. Just to be thorough. As a... side-investigation.\"",
		"\"You do?\" The lieutenant regards you with patient scepticism. \"It's a door in the back of the kitchen. Why do you care where it leads?\"",
		"\"Eccentric. But okay, I suppose we could look into it. As a... side-investigation.\"",
		"He looks at you, then at the door. \"Garte is the person to ask about this -- the cafeteria manager.\"",
		"\"If you say so.\" He looks at the door, then you. \"Garte is the person to ask about this -- the cafeteria manager.\"",
		"\"Hmm... Well, if there was a *winch*, I suppose we could look into it. As a... side-investigation.\"",
		"\"It *is* quite pretty. I suppose we could look into it. As a... side-investigation.\"",
		"\"We're not getting past it without a key. We should ask the bartender...\" He corrects himself. \"The cafeteria manager.\"",
		"\"Have you tried using the key?\" The lieutenant nods toward the lock. \"I suspect that will work.\"",
		"\"Well... Martinaise is riddled with bullet holes. This place saw a lot of action during the Revolution. But the statue *is* recently renovated -- so maybe a joke? Target practice? Or a political statement?\"",
		"He takes a note. \"I've made a note. Don't hold your breath.\"",
		"\"Why not?\" He shrugs. \"What this shows us is guns aren't too uncommon here. And people still shoot them. Sometimes at kings.\" He takes a note in his notebook.",
		"\"Looks like the students took your advice to heart, detective.\"",
		"\"Okay...\" He cleans his glasses before looking up. \"I can't see it. But I'll take your word for it.\"",
		"\"If we connect every bullet hole in Martinaise to the murder, we'll get an overwhelming amount of loose threads...\" He takes his notebook out. \"But then again, our guy *was* shot. And that hole would be recent.\"",
		"He takes a note. \"It's not *completely* tangential -- at least worth noting down. I wouldn't hold my breath, though.\"",
		"\"If we connect every bullet hole in Martinaise to the murder, we'll get an overwhelming amount of loose threads...\" He takes his notebook out. \"But then again, we don't really know what we're dealing with here, so...\"",
		"\"He's known as the father of scientific communism, also known as Mazovianism. His theories about economic history greatly influenced -- some would even say *sparked* -- the Antecentennial Revolution.\"",
		"\"Thank you for sharing this wonderful opinion on human sexuality.\" He pretends to read the economics book open on the table.",
		"\"Sure it is.\"",
		"\"I think you have misunderstood who he was, but...\" the lieutenant sighs. \"If you say so.\"",
		"He opens his eyes again, tilting his head in a quiet wonder. \"Why are you so hell-bent on proving that you're Kras Mazov anyway?\"",
		"\"There aren't many communists around -- not after the Revolution. Some youths still keep the ideology going, it seems.\"",
		"\"I suspect that's exactly what they're trying to do.\" He leans closer to inspect the economics book on the table.",
		"\"Except that Kras Mazov is dead. He's been dead for 50 years now.\"",
		"\"Alright. But here's the big thing -- Kras Mazov looks Samaran, and you don't.\"",
		"\"Then it's settled,\" says the lieutenant, straightening his back. \"You're not Kras Mazov.\"",
		"\"Well, you both do seem to share an affinity for sideburns. But it seems like old Kras here didn't drink nearly as much as you.\"",
		"\"Alright, *Kras*. You fought in the Revolution and everything,\" the lieutenant notes. \"If you say so.\"",
		"The lieutenant closes his eyes. \"Okay, you win. Be Kras Mazov then, I don't care...\"",
		"\"He was definitely controversial. The tenant here seems to like him...\" He leans closer to inspect the photos of revolutionaries on the wall.",
		"\"Sure you are.\"",
		"\"Hold on a second... Is this why you broke in here? To find out whether you're Kras Mazov?\"",
		"He puts a finger on a pale dot embellishing the bust's cheekbone. \"Doesn't he have a birthmark right here? What about you?\"",
		"\"You do -- but that's not the point. The point is, he doesn't look like you.\"",
		"The lieutenant raises a brow.",
		"\"The white star... the photos on the wall... I think we have broken into the apartment of a young communard.\" He looks around, before mumbling to himself: \"How fitting.\"",
		"\"Whoever lives here definitely shares your enthusiasm.\" He leans closer to inspect the photos of revolutionaries on the wall.",
		"The lieutenant doesn't even bother to reply to this.",
		"\"Very well.\" The lieutenant leans closer to the sculpture. \"Let's look for identifying features then...\"",
		"\"Yes, he does. Look at his eyes. Wasn't his mother a Samaran immigrant?\"",
		"\"It's decided -- you're *not* the most famous philosopher of the modern period.\" The lieutenant nods, turning away to inspect the photo on the other wall.",
		"\"Alright, *Kras*,\" the lieutenant notes. \"If you say so.\"",
		"\"Good, so you're not him.\"",
		"\"We've taken him to the city morgue. The local coroner will be contacting you shortly to arrange the funeral. Here's his number in case you want to contact him earlier.\" He hands her a leaflet with the morgue's contact information.",
		"\"Central Jamrock Public Library?\"",
		"\"I understand that this comes as a huge shock. I want you to know that me and my partner,\" he points at you, \"are here for you if you have any questions. We're very sorry for your loss, ma'am.\"",
		"The lieutenant nods at the woman, then looks back at you, his voice lowered: \"We should step outside and talk.\"",
		"\"Is there anything else that the RCM could do for you?",
		"\"He was taken to the city morgue. The local coroner will be contacting you shortly to arrange the funeral. Here's his number in case you want to contact him earlier.\" He hands her a leaflet with the morgue's contact information.",
		"\"Is there anything else that the RCM could do for you?\"",
		"The lieutenant has taken off his foggy glasses and is busy cleaning them in his handkerchief for now. You're on your own here.",
		"\"It looks like he slipped on the boardwalk -- fatally, I'm afraid. It was just a very unfortunate accident, although alcohol may have played a role.\"",
		"\"We understand this comes as a huge shock. I want you to know that me and my partner,\" he points at you, \"are here for you if you have any questions. Take your time, ma'am.\"",
		"The lieutenant steps in. \"We're very sorry to inform you, but your husband, Victor Méjean, was found dead this morning on the Martinaise boardwalk.\"",
		"\"We're very sorry to inform you, but your husband, Victor Méjean, was found dead this morning on the Martinaise boardwalk.\"",
		"\"Again, if there's anything we could do for you, then don't hesitate to call the RCM, ma'am.\"",
		"\"Is there anyone we could call for you? A friend, a family member, someone who could be here for you?\"",
		"The lieutenant closes his mouth, but he doesn't look pleased.",
		"\"Officer...\" the lieutenant warns you.",
		"\"Apologies, my partner,\" the lieutenant steps in, giving you a sideways glance, \"did *not* mean to make light of the situation.\"",
		"\"Here.\" The lieutenant takes out his handkerchief and offers it to the woman. She nods and slowly wipes away her tears.",
		"\"No, we *have*.\"",
		"\"Officer...\" the lieutenant warns you.",
		"\"Is there anyone we could call for you? A friend, a family member, someone who could be here for you?\"",
		"\"Easy, detective. No need to jump to conclusions.\" He eyes the spectacled man near the window, who smiles and spreads his hands.",
		"\"You do realize what you're doing, don't you?\" He whispers to you, *sotto voce*.",
		"\"It's certainly serious, sir. But there's also the question of jurisdiction. The Wayfarer Act places certain *strictures* on what matters the RCM may involve itself in.\"",
		"\"I suspect he doesn't know the half of it.\"",
		"\"No, that's not his...\" the lieutenant sighs. \"Martin Martinaise is a *joke*, a generic nickname for someone from Martinaise.\"",
		"The lieutenant gives you a sharp look. He's bailed you out, again, but he's none too pleased about it.",
		"\"Doing one's job doesn't automatically make one anyone's *bitch*. Besides, there are more nefarious powers to work for than the Moralintern.\"",
		"\"I think we can drop the drummer-angle,\" the lieutenant says impatiently. \"That was my bad.\"",
		"\"Basically it makes sure the price of bread doesn't change.\"",
		"The lieutenant is already scribbling down notes. \"What do you mean, 'like in a play'?\"",
		"\"Sounds like the victim *was* unconscious. Or at least incapacitated. Well done, detective.\" He nods to you.",
		"The lieutenant goes pale. 'No badge?' he mouths to himself, silently.",
		"\"There is no meaning, sir. Please excuse my colleague. This case has... been a great strain on his nerves.\"",
		"\"Were you able to see anything from inside?\"",
		"\"I think we have everything we need,\" the lieutenant says, closing his notebook. \"Thank you for talking to us, Mr. Villedrouin.\"",
		"\"Good god, detective. One more stunt like that and they'll have you institutionalized.\"",
		"\"Hmm, the novelty dicemaker also mentioned that she didn't hear any signs of a struggle.\"",
		"\"*Very* real trouble...\"",
		"The lieutenant raises his eyebrows as though he'd stopped paying attention.",
		"The lieutenant nods to you. \"That lines up with *previous testimony*, doesn't it? Well done, detective.\"",
		"\"I'm a lieutenant of the RCM, dedicated to maintaining law and order in Revachol.\"",
		"\"Yes, I was wondering the same thing.\"",
		"\"About what time was all this happening, approximately?\"",
		"He nods. \"There are more nefarious powers to work for than the Moralintern.\"",
		"\"I won't tell you how to do your job. But remember, this is an RCM matter. Make sure you weigh your next words carefully.\"",
		"The lieutenant takes out his notebook and nods to you to proceed.",
		"The lieutenant clears his throat. \"Of course, the detective's personal views do not represent the views of the RCM.\"",
		"The lieutenant looks you straight in the eye, trying to gauge your seriousness.",
		"\"Oh, good: 'Techno-tinkerers.' Just what this *side task* was missing...\"",
		"\"It seems this wasn't the 'break' you were hoping for...\"",
		"The lieutenant clears his throat. \"Of course, the detective's personal views do not represent the views of the RCM.\"",
		"\"Sounds like the victim was unconscious. Or at least incapacitated. Interesting.\"",
		"\"Hmmm. But we're fairly certain the lady driver was present...\" The lieutenant flips through his notes.",
		"\"A bunch of *what*, detective?\"",
		"The lieutenant makes a strange sound that he quickly smothers.",
		"The lieutenant sighs. \"A dead body we still need to get down, by the way.\"",
		"The lieutenant does his level best to suppress a deep sigh.",
		"\"Hmm, me? I... uh...\"",
		"The lieutenant lets out a long, nasal sigh.",
		"\"You're right, sir. I'll be sure to give the detective an overview of proper police procedure.\" The lieutenant darts a quick glance in your direction.",
		"\"Hmmm, perhaps your young friends in the *tent* might be of assistance?\"",
		"\"Hmmm, sounds like something that programmer we met in the church might be able to help with...\"",
		"\"Now let's go, before you get us into any *more* trouble.\"",
		"\"What the detective means is that he's proud to serve the RCM.\"",
		"The lieutenant sends you a sharp look at the mention of that number.",
		"\"A moment, if you don't mind, sir.\" The lieutenant pulls you aside.",
		"\"We could take him to Remedie or Saint Batiste, but he doesn't have money for medical services. The Almshouse would turn him down...\"",
		"\"I'm afraid it is. Look, it *moves*.\" He points to a fleshy lump sticking out from the other end of the blanket. The limb seems to be twitching from time to time.",
		"\"What is there to do? We could turn him on his side, so he doesn't choke on his own vomit. But he's already on his side...\"",
		"\"Mhmh...\" The lieutenant has covered his nose.",
		"\"Look, he's trying to communicate.\"",
		"\"I think he's still *quite* bad... I mean, what he has come to.\" The lieutenant tilts his head.",
		"\"They don't do charity for people who're trying to kill themselves. Besides, he'll be dead in a few...\" The lieutenant stops, listening to him.",
		"\"At least he got to say his piece.\"",
		"\"Can't you tell? It happens to exceptionally *committed* substance abusers. They fall asleep with their eyelids still open. Not a pretty sight.\"",
		"\"No, it really doesn't.\" The lieutenant tilts his head. \"This looks very hard to recover from.\"",
		"\"Well, judging by the colour of his hair I would say yes, it is.\"",
		"\"Are you saying a man who looks like Cuno broke into his father's apartment and passed out in his father's bed?\"",
		"\"This man won't be feeding his family any time soon. Not that he was, but...\" The lieutenant thinks to himself. \"At least he won't be beating his son.\"",
		"The lieutenant sighs. \"You really don't have to... Besides, he will understand you anyway.\"",
		"\"Right, you might have found the one person who doesn't know you are the law, given how drunk he is.\"",
		"\"There's no use in yelling at drunks,\" the lieutenant interjects. \"He's barely holding it together.\"",
		"\"There was little chance he'd be a reliable witness, anyway.\"",
		"\"Fine,\" he sighs.",
		"\"That is unhygienic. And dangerous. And it does not endear you to me -- just wanted to make that clear, okay?\"",
		"\"Seriously?\" The lieutenant closes his eyes and pinches the root of his nose. \"*Are* you?\"",
		"The lieutenant looks at you looking at the bottle of spirits. Then at Rosemary, suspiciously.",
		"\"Easy...\" the lieutenant whispers. \"Press her too hard and she'll...\"",
		"\"This is bad,\" the lieutenant whispers. \"Getting your weapon back is the priority. We can't have an unhinged civilian running around with a gun.\"",
		"The lieutenant coughs. \"You're taking those, are you?\"",
		"\"Sure.\" The lieutenant gives you his usual firm stare. \"I guess that's fine.\"",
		"\"I guess I got my answer.\" The lieutenant gives you his usual firm stare.",
		"\"You're making it worse, officer,\" the lieutenant says quietly. His eyes never leave the woman's face.",
		"\"Thank you.\" He pockets the drugs. \"I'm doing this to help you. We need to focus on the case.\"",
		"\"Madam! Please drop the firearm immediately!\"",
		"\"It's your hat.\" The lieutenant nods.",
		"\"Right.\" The lieutenant gives you his usual firm stare. Then sighs. \"Okay.\"",
		"\"I don't think she's on drugs,\" the lieutenant whispers. \"Being *off* drugs might actually be the problem here...\"",
		"\"You might not want to take those.\" The lieutenant states firmly. \"You seem to have a slight... problem...\"",
		"\"Ma'am, please...\" The lieutenant is trying to maintain eye-contact. \"We want to help you, but you need to lower that weapon.\"",
		"\"Oh. Is that yours?\"",
		"\"Officer...\" The lieutenant shakes his head and adds: \"There is *no* way I'm leaving it like this.\"",
		"The lieutenant nods. His eyes stay on the swaying firearm.",
		"The lieutenant nods.",
		"\"Wait, officer!\" the lieutenant shouts. \"We're trying to *de*-escalate the situation! Adding more guns just makes it worse.\"",
		"\"Now...\" the lieutenant takes a deep breath and steadies his voice, \"... is not the time.\"",
		"\"Be careful, detective. Don't do anything that might set her off.\"",
		"\"You're making it worse, officer,\" the lieutenant says quietly. His eyes never leave the woman's face.",
		"\"We can't leave. A delirious civilian is pointing a firearm at us. *Your* firearm. You *need* to solve this.\"",
		"The lieutenant's eyes stay fixed on the woman and her gun -- he studies them closely, then mumbles: \"Fascinating.\"",
		"\"What's the situation...\" the lieutenant hesitates addressing the woman, \"... officer?\"",
		"\"See?\" He glances at you. \"This is what happens, when we're not around.\"",
		"\"Actually, I think there is...\" He pauses. \"No, it's too much, he's joking.\"",
		"\"So you haven't seen anyone around?\"",
		"\"A pleasure wheel?\" The lieutenant looks wistfully at the horizon, as if picturing gondolas rising to the sky.",
		"\"Detective, a word.\" He turns to the blonde man. \"Excuse us a moment, please.\"",
		"In a low voice, the lieutenant whispers: \"I haven't the faintest idea who this gentleman is, but I've got a *hunch* he might have some affiliation with the Coalition, in case you're still serious about that *committee business*...\"",
		"\"Hmmm, she's not a 'Feld engineer,' exactly, but perhaps that programmer from the church might be of assistance?\"",
		"\"Nice to meet you.\" The lieutenant nods.",
		"\"In any case, I'll let you take it from here.\"",
		"\"He's correct. It makes coordinating operations with the Coalition exceedingly difficult, from our perspective.\"",
		"\"Oh, good: Now we're circuit-bending into radio towers. Just what this *side task* was missing...\"",
		"\"Hmmm, no one would mistake them for Feld engineers, but perhaps your young friends in the *tent* might be of assistance?\"",
		"\"We should probably let it be. This little 'foray' bears little connection to the case, no?\"",
		"The lieutenant says nothing. You see the machine's glowing frame reflected back from his diamond-shaped glasses. You're free to proceed.",
		"\"I doubt that we can find any. It's just idle fishermen's gossip to scare away the kids.\" He looks at the stained glass window.",
		"The lieutenant doesn't answer. He follows your gaze, studying the basins. The water shines in them. No ripples.",
		"The lieutenant leans closer, scouring the printout over your shoulder. Just as you finish reading he looks up, muttering under his breath:",
		"And before you have time to ask: \"No, I don't know how to operate it or what it's used for. Let's go.\"",
		"\"It's also quite similar to the one we have down at the station. Must be the same model.\" He inspects the machine's framework, careful not to touch anything.",
		"\"Another radiocomputer,\" says the lieutenant, stepping closer. \"And this time it's already turned on.\" He seems cautious around the machine.",
		"\"Fourth of February? That's over a month ago... Whoever set up those machines has been here for quite a while.\"",
		"\"Saint-Brune -- that's the church,\" the lieutenant gestures around him, \"and Rue de Saint-Ghislaine, that's the Doomed Commercial Area.\"",
		"\"The pillar of silence! She *is* talking about the silence... Is she suggesting it's more than just an architectural quirk?\"",
		"\"Is she talking about...?\" The lieutenant looks to his right, toward the silence.",
		"\"Something about the backup data getting destroyed... and how everyone thought it was the author's fault.\" He adjusts his glasses. \"Let's just keep reading.\"",
		"\"Psst, someone's coming...\"",
		"\"Why would anyone need *any* of this equipment here?\" He steps on a wire running on the ground, inspecting it with his boot.",
		"\"Her friends, colleagues?\" He shrugs. \"She must be quite educated if she knew how to set up all this machinery.\"",
		"The lieutenant whispers into your ear: \"She repeats passwords. Programming people are all... paranoid.\"",
		"\"I do apologize for the intrusion, madam. We're with the RCM, you see.\"",
		"\"We should probably let it be. It's becoming clear that there's no trace of the suspect anywhere inside the church.\"",
		"\"The girl on the ice? Sounds like her, yes.\"",
		"\"Let's look around. There's no use trying to guess the answer.\"",
		"\"The strike...\" He strokes his chin. \"We're nearing the date of the murder.\"",
		"\"Keep reading, I'm interested now -- I want to know what's that radio anomaly that sent this person here in the first place.\"",
		"\"I'm afraid we're not doing that. Unless we want to wait for a month.\"",
		"\"Maybe *he* knows something.\" The lieutenant nods toward Tiago.",
		"\"A radiocomputer,\" says the lieutenant, stepping closer. \"And it's turned on.\" He seems cautious around the machine.",
		"The lieutenant doesn't say anything, but you can sense that he doesn't like you meddling with the machine.",
		"\"We should leave; I doubt this place bears any connection to the case.\"",
		"\"Seems like something to do with radiocomputers -- unfortunately, I don't know enough about them to understand what the author is saying.\"",
		"\"I think these people worked in the radiocomputer games business. The one we saw in the Doomed Commercial Area. They must be her former co-workers.\"",
		"\"Our case? No, I don't think so. It must be some local...\" his eyes wander to the various machines around him, \"*eccentric*.\"",
		"\"I knew it wasn't a good idea to meddle with that machine...\"",
		"\"A radiocomputer,\" the lieutenant repeats a little impatiently, \"we have one down at the station.\"",
		"\"Nothing *spooky* about this place either, it's just abandoned. And cold. And in an awful part of town...\"",
		"\"I just have to find out what caused that data loss and be done with it. Still don't understand how it managed to wipe out the backup when the backup *wasn't even connected to the front*. I know, I know... everyone thinks it's impossible; they say I must be lying. I'm here to set it right.\"",
		"\"We should talk to her,\" the lieutenant whispers, \"after she has rebooted the machine.\"",
		"\"You were making *prank calls*.\" Not a muscle moves in the lieutenant's face.",
		"\"What the hell are you doing?\" The lieutenant has been keeping a distance, but steps closer now.",
		"\"You're right, you shouldn't have.\"",
		"The lieutenant is too far away to hear your yelp. The sea wind blows...",
		"\"Khm...\" A single *khm* lets you know the lieutenant is ready to move now.",
		"\"Are we about *done* with this now?\" The lieutenant has taken a few steps back.",
		"\"Big deal?!\" Not a muscle moves in the lieutenant's face.",
		"\"Officer -- that's enough. Let's return to work...\"",
		"Still calling...",
		"\"That's enough now, officer...\" The lieutenant stands at a distance.",
		"\"What the hell are you doing?\" The lieutenant has been keeping a distance, but steps closer now.",
		"\"Let's just go, I've had enough of this phone booth.\"",
		"The lieutenant shrugs apathetically, then walks a little distance away to concentrate on his notes. Looks like he'd rather not get into it again.",
		"The lieutenant raises his eyebrow, but doesn't say anything.",
		"\"Did it ever seem to you like she was hiding here from something?\" The lieutenant seems to be thinking the same. He takes out his little notebook.",
		"\"Do you remember your name, sir?\"",
		"The lieutenant raises his eyebrows and coughs.",
		"The lieutenant whispers to you, quietly. \"This man is obviously a habitual narcotics user. Do we really need to question him?\"",
		"\"That was... an interesting conversation.\"",
		"\"You know, actually, since we're here -- you may want to pay attention to what the ceiling climber is saying.\"",
		"\"However, I'm still not sure how it's relevant to our investigation.\"",
		"\"How did you even find this place -- this church?\"",
		"\"Did you witness it?\"",
		"\"I see.\" The lieutenant seems contented with that answer. \"And where is she now?\"",
		"\"However, I'm still not sure whether we'll find our suspect here.\"",
		"\"Great -- and here I thought we were finally going to the island...\" the lieutenant murmurs to himself.",
		"\"Interesting, a police officer trying to evict a citizen from a public space despite the Wayfarer Act.\"",
		"\"They should really allocate some renovation funds to this place...\" murmurs the lieutenant, inspecting the damage done to the arabesques.",
		"The lieutenant looks down at the floor, as if to say you're wasting time here.",
		"\"Problematically so, one might even argue.\"",
		"\"It is, yes. It's against the law. We're cops -- the law is *important* to us.\"",
		"The lieutenant nods stoically.",
		"\"Incredible...\" the lieutenant murmurs. \"This would also explain why we get it on the police radio all the time.\"",
		"\"We would appreciate it if you kept this knowledge to yourself, miss.\"",
		"The lieutenant sighs, but says nothing.",
		"\"Is that *really* necessary, detective?\"",
		"\"It was *very* hard not to. I think you're right,\" he turns to the woman. \"There *is* something going on here -- and you need to be *very* careful with it.\"",
		"\"Detective, does the 41st not require its officers to pass Elementary Radio Operations? I thought it was an RCM-wide policy.\"",
		"\"Something tells me Ms. Messier would be *less than thrilled* to hear you plan to commandeer her boat so you can talk to a Coalition warship.\"",
		"\"It's the Wayfarer Act again,\" the lieutenant says, nodding. \"You can't just throw citizens out of public spaces, at least not legally.\"",
		"\"Good luck,\" the lieutenant notes. \"I'm *not* coming in there.\"",
		"\"I highly doubt that. When I crank the volume on my DynaWave, it's like you're in the front row at the National Concert Hall.\"",
		"\"And she's not. Disrupting any order, I mean.\"",
		"The lieutenant raises his brows, but doesn't say anything.",
		"\"Wonderful,\" the lieutenant whispers, admiring the embellished pillars and the spectacular architecture in the church.",
		"\"No, don't mind me, go on with your little project. I'm sure you can spin it as an under-cover op. Many cops do.\"",
		"The lieutenant pretends he didn't see your little temper tantrum, preferring to inspect the golden stained glass window instead.",
		"The lieutenant coughs like he's amused.",
		"The lieutenant leans closer to whisper: \"I've never witnessed a programmer work before...\"",
		"\"In his defence, it was simply lying in the desk drawer of an abandoned cubicle.\"",
		"\"Thank you, Egg Head. Let's leave it at that, shall we? We have un-entroponetic detection to perform in this district.\"",
		"\"Joke all you want, detective. Whatever radio you manage to scrounge up won't lay a *finger* on my set-up.\"",
		"\"You know, we don't actually have to tell the entire world about the fridge,\" the lieutenant says, looking at you.",
		"\"Yes. And we have to get back to stabilizing Martinaise...\" He breathes out, trying to shake off tension. \"Instead of demolishing it with loud bass noise of unknown origins.\"",
		"\"Great -- after we've done this, we can finally get to the island,\" the lieutenant says, satisfied.",
		"\"Apologies, I was just thinking out loud. Go on.\"",
		"In the corner of your eye, the lieutenant steps aside cautiously, his eyes searching for a possible evacuation route.",
		"\"You okay?\"",
		"\"Back across the waterlock. At least we're getting our *exercise* in today.\"",
		"\"Put the gun down, detective.\" The lieutenant's voice is low and firm.",
		"\"Wonderful,\" the lieutenant whispers. \"Now this place is also going to be a drug lab. Always something fascinating happening in tents.\"",
		"The lieutenant's too. He takes his glasses off.",
		"\"And before you ask: No, you can't have the radio from my Kineema.\"",
		"\"Oh, I see,\" the lieutenant says, raising a finger, \"this is connected to the drug manufacturing thing.\"",
		"\"An amateur-entroponetic police officer... I'd like to say I've heard stranger things, but I'm not sure. This is a hell of a guess, however. Well worded I might add...\"",
		"\"Ma'am, you will *certainly* sound mad.\"",
		"\"She's not joking. Even the RCM has to receive special approval from the Coalition to access that kind of equipment.\"",
		"\"You do know there's no need to officially document this information, right?\" the lieutenant whispers to you.",
		"\"The pillar of silence? Are you sure it's not just an architectural quirk?\"",
		"\"I also have a question -- since we're piling them on. How do *you* know this? I'm not doubting you,\" he explains, \"I'm simply curious as to how a detective of the RCM...\"",
		"\"Detective...\"",
		"The lieutenant takes a step back...",
		"\"Now this house of worship is also going to be a drug lab... Always something fascinating happening in tents.\"",
		"\"Let's see if anyone's home. Knock on the door.\"",
		"\"The smoker on the balcony. This is why we're here, right? He might know something about the murder. So, tonight at 21.00?\"",
		"\"Tomorrow evening, right here, apartment #28. Good. Let's go.\"",
		"\"It's alright, we don't have to be here 21.00 sharp, I just need to write something down in my notebook.\" He has already opened the little blue book.",
		"\"It's alright, we don't have to be here 21.00 sharp, I just need to write something down in my notebook.\" He has already opened the little blue book.",
		"\"Let's go. There's nothing to do here for us anymore.\"",
		"\"Looks like the young man we're looking for isn't home. I think our best chance to catch him is in the evening.\" He looks around, taking in the cold spring air.",
		"\"Tomorrow 21.00, right here, apartment #28.\" He writes it down into his little notebook. \"Good. Let's go.\"",
		"\"Tonight at 21.00, right here, apartment #28.\" He writes it down into his little notebook. \"Good. Let's go.\"",
		"\"We should return tomorrow after we have finished with our day's work -- how about 21.00, sound good?\"",
		"\"We should talk to him.\" The lieutenant nods at the man standing right next to the door.",
		"\"Tonight, right here, apartment #28. Good. Let's go.\"",
		"\"We should return tonight after we have finished with our day's work -- how about 21.00, sound good?\"",
		"\"We should return tomorrow -- tomorrow at 21.00,\" the lieutenant reminds you.",
		"\"The smoker on the balcony. This is why we're here, right? He might know something about the murder. So, tomorrow 21.00?\"",
		"\"We should return in the evening -- at 21.00 the earliest.\"",
		"\"Looks like the young man we're looking for isn't home. I think our best chance to catch him is in the evening.\" He looks around, taking in the cold spring air.",
		"\"Let's go. There's nothing to do here for us anymore.\"",
		"The lieutenant motions you to go ahead and knock.",
		"\"Now, delivering a death notification is never an easy task. There's a reason why it's often called the most stressful part of our job. This is why it's usually done in pairs. You got this. I'll be monitoring reactions, ready to act if necessary.\"",
		"\"We have our first preliminary identification -- in all likelihood the deceased is the husband of Billie Méjean. We need to confirm this, as well as deliver the death notification to Billie herself.\"",
		"\"Chances are that whoever's going to greet us behind that door is somehow related to the deceased. This means that our job here is to deliver the death notification, as well as identify the body.\"",
		"\"It's too late, I think everyone's already asleep. We should try again tomorrow.\"",
		"He gives you a short encouraging nod.",
		"The lieutenant motions towards the door.",
		"\"You're right, let's talk this through.\" He looks at the apartment door and lowers his voice a bit...",
		"\"Dead? Just don't say that you know how they feel. You don't.\"",
		"\"We can't. Someone has to deliver the news.\" He motions towards the door. \"Let's go.\"",
		"\"Yes, it's hard.\" He stares at the front door for a moment, his face still. \"But there is no easy way to handle this information. It just has to happen, as soon as possible.\"",
		"The lieutenant shakes his head. \"We've no business here. Let's get back to the investigation.\"",
		"The lieutenant looks worried. \"I know there's no stopping you -- but let's at least make this quick.\"",
		"The lieutenant smiles. \"Trouble with the chain, officer?\"",
		"\"*Supreme-titanium*?\" The lieutenant blinks. \"Sure. A door inside this complex has super-hard, super-expensive chains.\"",
		"The lieutenant arches his eyebrows, surprised. \"Well... no. I guess not.\"",
		"\"And the place comes with three months' worth of utility bills.\"",
		"\"Of course, officer.\" The lieutenant smiles obligingly. \"My RCM regulation, recently distributed cutters are the problem.\"",
		"\"Why would we want to break into some random citizen's apartment?\"",
		"\"I believe it's the *shackle* you mean to cut, detective.\" The lieutenant points to the corroded loop with a gloved finger.",
		"\"You seem committed to it, so go on.\"",
		"The lieutenant doesn't say a word, his face wiped clear of any emotion.",
		"\"Perhaps you should give it another go?\"",
		"The lieutenant looks at you for a long moment, then blinks once...",
		"\"After you, detective.\"",
		"He takes a closer look at the lock. \"I supposed if one were *committed* to it, there's a pair of chaincutters in the Kineema.\"",
		"The lieutenant is concentrated on the hallway, scanning both ways for any approachers.",
		"The lieutenant looks at the sword with distrust in his eyes.",
		"Keeping a tactful distance, the lieutenant takes out his notebook, demonstrating complete disinterest in your \"date.\"",
		"The lieutenant makes a show of glancing at his watch and tapping his foot.",
		"Uncomfortable shuffle of nylon.",
		"\"I hope this has been refreshing for you, detective,\" the lieutenant says, watching her leave. \"Let's return to our search with a fresh pair of eyes.\"",
		"\"That's a big leap, but from what I've heard, this Ruby sounds pretty desperate. Either way,\" he looks at the bullet again, \"this is enough to confront the washerwoman.\"",
		"\"Either way,\" he looks at the bullet again, \"this is enough to confront her with.\"",
		"\"Yes, for muzzleloaders like the ones officers of the RCM carry. Interesting.\"",
		"\"Someone hid it as extra ammunition?\"",
		"The lieutenant studies the bullet in your hand. \"Still, interesting.\"",
		"\"That's something of a leap -- but we should be on our guard. Either way,\" he looks at the bullet again, \"this is enough to confront the washerwoman.\"",
		"\"See anything interesting?\"",
		"The lieutenant nods.",
		"\"I don't know, could be. The washerwoman was clearly withholding something -- and she *does* rent this place out to people.\"",
		"The lieutenant nods toward it and says: \"Map of Martinaise. This could work maybe?\"",
		"The lieutenant coughs sharply, then whispers: \"Perhaps not. It's against RCM policy to defraud small business owners.\"",
		"\"The entire series is also *endearingly* racist, if I may add.\"",
		"\"Something the matter, detective?\"",
		"The lieutenant narrows his eyes and contemplates the book for a moment.",
		"\"I would certainly say she fits that description, providing that's your type.\"",
		"The lieutenant nods. You think you detect the faintest trace of a grin on his face, but you can't say for certain.",
		"\"No. If there is reasonable suspicion, we must investigate. Otherwise she could claim we're siding with the Union. Or that we're on their take. We'd never hear the end of it...\"",
		"\"This woman is running circles around us. She might have known about your *misplaced badge* all along -- or she's simply an adept improviser. Either way, we've played straight into her hands.\"",
		"\"Honestly, I was expecting you to use your *unorthodox technique* to keep her off-balance -- and you know... *not* volunteer us to be her henchmen.\"",
		"\"I wouldn't go that far. Her reaction did come off as sincere to me... I think she's just quick to adapt. She is a professional, after all.\"",
		"\"You could request a new one from your station but that would literally take *months*.\"",
		"\"This isn't going very well.\"",
		"\"What I propose is -- we ask her. Then we investigate. *Briefly*...\" He adjusts his glasses. \"But do *not* share the outcome of this investigation with her. We tell her it's done and demand for her information on the lynching.\"",
		"\"It would not hurt if you *tried* more in the future, yes.\"",
		"\"I'm sure you will, detective.\"",
		"\"Yes. Knowing this does not really change our position, however.\"",
		"\"Oh,\" he nods slowly. \"That would be *fantastic*. But do we have the time? The world is large -- and your badge is eight-by-six centimetres.\"",
		"The lieutenant only shakes his head. \"Let's just do it, shall we?\"",
		"\"We still have to deal with her...\" He adjusts his coat. \"Not pleasant, I know. But we can't leave her like that. And we have to investigate the scene, too.\"",
		"\"We still need to investigate the scene. Remember?\"",
		"\"Her journal? We should probably leaf through it. Might learn something useful.\"",
		"\"Be that as it may, it doesn't change the fact. We have a duty to her. Let's see it through.\" He gestures back toward the tunnels. \"After you.\"",
		"He gestures back toward the tunnels. \"After you.\"",
		"The lieutenant clears his throat. \"Detective -- aren't you forgetting something?\"",
		"He gestures back toward the tunnels. \"After you.\"",
		"The lieutenant clears his throat. \"Detective -- aren't you forgetting something?\"",
		"The lieutenant only shakes his head. \"Let's just do it, shall we?\"",
		"\"We still have to deal with her...\" He adjusts his coat. \"Not pleasant, I know. But we can't leave her like that. And we have to investigate the scene, too.\"",
		"\"Be that as it may, it doesn't change the fact. We have a duty to her. Let's see it through.\" He gestures back toward the tunnels. \"After you.\"",
		"\"We still need to investigate the scene. Remember?\"",
		"\"Her journal? We should probably leaf through it. Might learn something useful.\"",
		"\"Alright.\" The lieutenant's face stiffens as he turns to look at the road ahead. \"I won't ask again.\"",
		"\"Of course it has.\" He doesn't even look too surprised.",
		"...but then he turns away -- his gaze fixed on the road ahead. \"Let's go,\" he concludes.",
		"\"That makes absolutely no sense.\" He thinks for a moment. \"But I guess every family has its own traditions.\"",
		"\"I've got to ask...\" he says, a peculiar look in his eyes. \"What are you doing?\"",
		"\"That makes two of us.\" He shakes his head slowly. \"Let's not waste any more time under this boardwalk. We need to clear this all up... somehow.\"",
		"\"No harm? In drinking 98.7% alcohol with a god-knows-how-old tie in it? I wouldn't be so sure.\" The lieutenant tilts his head slightly. \"However, I'm not here to judge. Let's go.\"",
		"\"Right. Okay. Anyway, I'm glad you told me your necktie has been speaking to you. That must not have been easy.\" For a second it looks like he's about to add something...",
		"\"Okay. So why did you put it in the bottle?\"",
		"\"And what has the necktie been telling you, if I may ask?\"",
		"\"I would assume, yes. Why did you put it in the bottle?\"",
		"\"Let us not linger. We have a great big mess to figure out.\" He turns to face the road ahead.",
		"The lieutenant has been observing you quietly all this time.",
		"\"Wonderful. Very useful.\"",
		"\"A relationship between a man and a talking necktie? No, apparently I am not.\" His voice rings of insincere sadness as he turns to leave.",
		"\"That was nice,\" the lieutenant smiles. \"A small thing for us, but invaluable to him. He probably didn't even know René had the photo.\"",
		"The lieutenant gives you a long, slow shake of his head.",
		"\"Yes.\" The lieutenant nods. \"We are both very sorry for your loss.\"",
		"\"We are both very sorry for your loss,\" the lieutenant bows his head. \"Death of a friend is a terrible thing.\"",
		"\"No, you are not. Enforcing proper conduct in an amateur pétanque game is not something the RCM involves itself in.\" He smiles. \"It doesn't matter.\"",
		"\"Come. We need to go now.\" The lieutenant puts his hand on your shoulder.",
		"\"Well,\" the lieutenant says, frowning ever so slightly, \"maybe don't just say every little thing in your head out loud. It confuses people.\"",
		"\"Believe me,\" the lieutenant replies -- sounding a little defensive -- \"it's plenty enough. Kineema feels right at home on the raised motor tract. Hard to find something that could overtake it.\"",
		"\"Don't leave fingerprints on the bodywork, I just had it polished.\"",
		"He stares at you, intrigued.",
		"\"No, that's... *porno*-tuning.\"",
		"\"Porno. That's short for pornography.\"",
		"\"Yeah, you know it?\" The lieutenant seems surprised.",
		"\"Oh...\" The lieutenant rubs the back of his head. \"Yes, let's definitely *think* about it.\"",
		"\"Binoclard... binoclard...\" he repeats to himself, eyes fixed on the ground.",
		"\"That's a negative on the porno. Thank you, though.\"",
		"\"Maybe,\" he replies with an apologetic smile and nods. \"Yes, definitely maybe.\"",
		"\"Maybe don't blurt out everything that *pops into your head*. Just some friendly advice. Anyway...\"",
		"\"Those spinners were elegant, sleek...\" He pauses, looking for words. \"Radiant, even. What you're suggesting is *porno*.\"",
		"\"Yes.\" There's gentleness in the lieutenant's voice as his eyes run over the vehicle's contours. \"An extraordinary machine.\"",
		"\"You lost me there.\" He is looking at you, perplexed.",
		"\"Actually, I have a pair at home -- just haven't gotten around to fitting them yet. I need to lay some wiring for the ballasts first...\"",
		"\"Uh... yes, that's right.\" He stares at you in surprise. \"I am very impressed that you know these things.\"",
		"\"I am not a *binoclard*, I am a driver... and a police lieutenant.\"",
		"\"I'm perfectly proud of my glasses.\" The lieutenant adjusts his spectacles. \"I need them for seeing. Anyway...\"",
		"\"Basically, yes -- although it's mostly about frequency range, not the wires making *bwee-*sounds. Still -- I'm impressed.\"",
		"\"I have pretty much maintained my vehicles by myself ever since one was assigned to me. You inevitably pick up some knowledge on the way.\"",
		"\"Sorry, I'm not following you?\"",
		"\"Hang on, you're telling me you remember all these little mechanical details, but you have trouble remembering your name?\"",
		"\"I'm sincerely relieved I don't have to try and convince you of that.\" He glances at his vehicle. \"Back to work?\"",
		"\"The Kineema *is* fast. Feels right at home on the raised motor tract. Hard to find something that could overtake it.\"",
		"\"Okay.\" The lieutenant nods too. \"That's confusing. Can we get back to business now?\"",
		"\"Seven-point-two. Supercharged.\" The lieutenant is trying to suppress a smug smile. Unsuccessfully.",
		"\"We are not going to though, because this is clearly a *sports* motor carriage.\" Sounds like he has a strong concept of what this machine is.",
		"\"When the frequency of the current in the coils falls within the audible range  the resulting vibration creates the *whiny sound* you mentioned.\"",
		"\"Anything else?\"",
		"\"When variable current passes through wires that make up the coils on the electrical systems on this machine -- it causes vibration in the wires and the cores of the coils.\"",
		"\"You want to help?\" He glances at you and smiles. \"Thank you for the offer. That might be fun. Let's do the case first though, alright?\"",
		"\"Right,\" the lieutenant marks dryly. \"Speed isn't for everyone.\"",
		"\"You mean the coil noise?\"",
		"\"Sure, go ahead.\"",
		"\"Mhmh.\" The lieutenant smiles ever so slightly. \"You want to take a closer look?\"",
		"\"The resulting vibration creates the whining sound, that's right,\" the lieutenant finishes your sentence. \"Very impressive.\"",
		"\"Of course...\" His gaze wanders over your face.",
		"\"Thanks.\" The lieutenant smiles. \"Are we done here?\"",
		"\"Kilowatts,\" the lieutenant replies laconically.",
		"\"Mhmh...\" the lieutenant huffs. \"No point in stopping then.\"",
		"\"Hundred-and-thirty.\"",
		"\"Strange... but plausible, I guess.\" He gives you a quick side-glance and turns to go. \"I guess you're a bit of a... torque dork too.\"",
		"\"Seems like Klaasje wasn't lying when she said it was her.\" The lieutenant makes a note. \"This corroborates her story -- she made the call.\"",
		"\"Fine.\" The lieutenant clenches his jaw. \"But know that I don't approve of such gratuitous volatility.\"",
		"\"Apparently so. Please do try to control yourself.\" The anger is gone from his eyes and it's almost as if his voice is softer than before.",
		"\"What?\" The lieutenant raises his shoulders. \"What is it?\"",
		"\"Legally, no. In reality, yes.\" He looks around. \"Martinaise is *de facto* policed by the Dockworkers' Union.\"",
		"\"Right. Well... Are we almost done now, officer?\"",
		"\"It was someone else.\" The lieutenant makes a note. \"We'll find them sooner or later, officer. It just might take a while.\"",
		"The lieutenant goes pale. 'Missing badge?' he mouths to himself, silently.",
		"\"Hey!\" The lieutenant interrupts with a flicker of anger in his eyes. \"If you cannot restrain yourself then I'll be handling the interviews from now on and you can quietly take notes.\"",
		"\"Not *all* of us.\" The lieutenant shakes his head. \"Acts like that stick with you for a while.\"",
		"\"Hmh...\" An imperceptible nod.",
		"\"*We* shouldn't do anything. I don't tempt such forces.\"",
		"\"*Why* would you say that?\" The lieutenant turns to you, more surprised than angry.",
		"\"Just take it easy,\" he says with what seems like excessive caution.",
		"The lieutenant nods.",
		"\"You will see.\"",
		"\"Let's go, officer. I've had enough of this.\"",
		"\"What is this, then? A tool shed?\" He peeks inside. \"Let's investigate.\"",
		"The lieutenant tilts his head but makes no comment.",
		"\"None taken,\" the lieutenant quickly replies and then turns to you: \"Did we have anything else to do here, Harry?\"",
		"\"I think we'd like to ask you a few questions. Don't you think so, detective?\" The lieutenant looks quite fed up with the situation.",
		"\"There was a guy in the container,\" the lieutenant says slowly. \"But he didn't bend any light. That was in the detective's head.\"",
		"\"Officer, we will deal with this later. We don't need Mr. Claire's help with this.\"",
		"\"Thank you for understanding,\" the lieutenant looks him in the eye. \"We will continue to do what we must.\"",
		"\"You wanted us to relay all this information to her...\" the lieutenant cuts in.",
		"\"Okay, enough! We are here to ask you some questions pertaining to a murder investigation.\"",
		"\"We are,\" the lieutenant says firmly as he meets Evrart's gaze. \"And we will do our best to ensure that's what happens here.\"",
		"\"You wanted us to relay all this information to her...\"",
		"\"You wanted us to relay all this information to her...\" the lieutenant cuts in.",
		"\"You know what, detective? I am going to leave this out of my report, and I suggest you leave it out of yours too.\"",
		"\"Where are these boys?\"",
		"\"Funny,\" the lieutenant says, looking up from his notebook. \"She was trying to set up a narcotics operation in the old church on the coast.\"",
		"The lieutenant stands right next to you, not showing any signs of impatience or boredom.",
		"\"Don't be dramatic. I can see your condition isn't terminal.\"",
		"\"It sounds to me like you're trying to start an amphetamine lab in the district,\" the lieutenant says with an uncharacteristic note of contempt in his voice. \"And you're using some delinquents you found god knows where to set it up and run it for you.\"",
		"\"You go ahead, detective.\" The lieutenant nods at you, then the chair.",
		"\"Who is this Miss Beaufort?\" The lieutenant looks up at Leo.",
		"\"Yes, this place really seems to run like clockwork. Keep it up, Leo.\" The lieutenant smiles at the little man.",
		"\"Told you.\"",
		"You see disdain in the lieutenant's dark eyes when they meet yours for a moment. He does not approve of you ridiculing this little man.",
		"\"Looks like it.\"",
		"\"Yes. They're hiding it from the inside. All the red containers have the Débardeurs' Union logo on them.\"",
		"\"Thank you for clarifying that, sir.\"",
		"\"I hate to break this bonding moment, but the red containers mean they're replacing the company livery with the Union livery. Which means this strike isn't gonna stop any time soon.\"",
		"\"So *no one* is working?\"",
		"\"Easy, Leo, let's keep this on the Hardies.\" He looks to you for assistance.",
		"\"Let's go,\" the lieutenant says, \"we don't have a reason to get inside that apartment.\"",
		"\"That was smart,\" the lieutenant says, nodding toward the unlocked door.",
		"\"No need to worry,\" the lieutenant steps in, \"we're not saying you did.\"",
		"\"We should probably proceed with our business in Martinaise.\" The lieutenant interrupts her, turning to you. \"Unless you didn't have any more *official* questions?\"",
		"\"Yes. A representative of the harbour. She should have set up operations nearby.\"",
		"\"We should proceed with our business in Martinaise.\" The lieutenant turns to you.",
		"\"Don't worry, miss. We're here to clean it up -- you can get to work soon.\"",
		"\"He knows where we are. He just wants directions.\" The lieutenant seems uncomfortable with the level of disorientation you are displaying.",
		"\"You've been resting here for quite a *while*, haven't you?\" The lieutenant intervenes, looking at her intently.",
		"\"We should proceed with our business in Martinaise.\" The lieutenant turns to you.",
		"\"I understand -- the RCM isn't welcome here and the locals want to keep an eye on us.\"",
		"\"That was the last time, miss.\" He looks at you with a stern expression. \"Our questioning here is concluded. Let's go.\"",
		"\"We should probably proceed with our business in Martinaise.\" The lieutenant interrupts her, turning to you. \"Unless you didn't have any more *official* questions?\"",
		"\"Relax, miss. This is not an interrogation. We are just checking some facts.\"",
		"\"You don't have to stay up because of us.\"",
		"\"The kid did this, right? The red-haired rat? Can't say a sentence without *f****t* or *kipt*... He's always giving me trouble.\"",
		"\"That's okay, miss -- do what you have to do.\" The lieutenant nods at you. \"I think we're done here. Let's go.\"",
		"\"Yes, how very childish of you,\" he mumbles. \"In your -- and my -- defence, almost everyone in the RCM uses the *titular* system. In addition to the official alphanumeric.\"",
		"\"That's okay.\" He nods, then turns back to his own case files. \"We all make mistakes.\"",
		"\"Good. That's a good one...\"",
		"\"Okay. Okay.\" He nods. \"It's a good name, but it has *one* problem -- this case has nothing to do with the setting sun. At all. It has nothing to do with that. So...\"",
		"\"That's okay.\" He nods, then turns back to his own case files. \"We all do, sooner or later.\"",
		"Wordless, he pulls one from the loop and hands it to you. The pen is cold, blue, and ready to write.",
		"He smiles. \"I pray his loved ones never find out.\"",
		"\"Ha! Yes.\" He isn't actually laughing. \"I have to tell you officer, I don't appreciate *ironic* titles. Other officers will have to use this as reference. If it's 'IDIOT', or 'COCK FINGER'...\"",
		"\"Are you sure? I think it's pretty serviceable...\"",
		"He is not really saying anything. Just standing there -- looking at them.",
		"\"Right. Of course.\" He returns to his notes, leaving you to yours.",
		"\"Detective, is everything alright?\"",
		"\"I'm sad to hear that.\" For a moment he doesn't know what to reply.",
		"\"Okay, no problem.\" He turns away to start organizing his own notes -- leaving you with yours.",
		"\"Boring? Try *dangerous*. You should do a thorough inventory of that -- make sure some has not fallen into the hands of the RCM's enemies: organized crime, or worse... Official notes sometimes contain informants' names, even undercover operatives.\"",
		"\"Huh?\" He raises his nose from his notes. \"Two *complex* cases to undertake is a lot, yes. You *really* have to push yourself. I would not suggest it. Lest you start making mistakes.\"",
		"\"Two?\" He raises both eyebrows. \"That's a lot. I didn't mean to say you're making mistakes, by the way. That was presumptuous of me.\"",
		"\"I don't know either...\" He points to the ruined notes. \"You should take stock of those, make sure it's all there. Official notes contain informants' names, undercover operatives even. If some of it has fallen into the hands of the RCM's adversaries, bloodletting may well ensue.\"",
		"\"All RCM vehicles have headlights designed to reveal halogen watermarks. Mine too.\"",
		"\"Oh, you mean the *titular*. Yes, well... So do I. In our defence -- almost everyone in the RCM does.\"",
		"\"Rail spike through the head. He died. It was a work place accident.\"",
		"\"Huh? Oh, yes. The name, good. What is it?\"",
		"\"...something more concrete perhaps? Do you have something *concrete*? Mundane. *Usual*.\"",
		"\"Oh! That's actually what *I* was thinking -- THE HANGED MAN.\" He nods. \"I like that. A good, strong name. We have a very good name for the case now.\"",
		"\"It depends. Aside from an anti-counterfeiting stamp, mine has my station number and address. The information varies by date of issue.\"",
		"He flips the pages of his notebook. \"I'm going to start calling it THE HANGED MAN. It's good we sorted this out.\"",
		"\"You had to lose because of *dark vibes*? What are you talking about?\"",
		"\"I prefer a *normal* case load.\" He turns back to his own case files. \"It's a matter of methods.\"",
		"\"In any case, we're lucky you found it. Make sure it's all in there. Official notes are... well they're dangerous, they contain confidentialities.\"",
		"\"What?\" He is lost in his own notes. It takes a moment for him to see it. \"That thing? It's a halogen watermark. We use it for adding information to RCM property.\"",
		"\"Great! That's great. That's actually what *I* was thinking too -- THE HANGED MAN. Good, strong name. We have a very good name for the case now.\"",
		"\"No -- actually. Any ideas?\"",
		"\"Do-eth thou also thorough inventories?\" He points to the ruined notes. \"You should take stock of those. Official notes contain informants' names, undercover operatives even. If some of it has fallen into the hands of the RCM's adversaries, bloodletting may well ensue.\"",
		"\"Yes.\" There is a pause. \"RCM vehicles have headlights tuned especially to reveal halogen watermarks.\"",
		"\"Well... so do I. In our defence, officer, almost everyone in the RCM does.\"",
		"\"Oh... Well, then maybe I can suggest one?\"",
		"\"THE HANGED MAN.\"",
		"\"You had to lose it for *the bloodletting* to begin? What are you talking about?\"",
		"After a while he can't take it anymore. \"Excuse me, I just have to ask again -- *how* did it get in the trash?\"",
		"\"What?\" He is lost in his own notes. It takes a moment for him to see it. \"Yes, a halogen watermark used for adding information to RCM property.\"",
		"\"Okay.\" He returns to his neatly kept notes...",
		"\"Again, in your defence, I seem to have named one...\" He peeks into his notes. \"THE MAN WITH THE HOLE IN HIS HEAD. That was a real person, his death was real. Still I named it that. To amuse myself.\"",
		"\"Furies. Yes. Well.\" It's obvious he doesn't like it. \"I don't know. I have to be honest -- I'm not experiencing the *internal strife* that refers to. And also...\" He furrows his brow.",
		"Absolutely motionless at first, then animated slowly, imperceptibly even, the lieutenant begins to browse his notes again. Leaving you to the case files.",
		"\"You mean the alphanumeric -- officer, precinct, time of arrival at the scene?\"",
		"\"Okay then.\" He returns to his notes, abruptly. \"The case doesn't need to have a name.\"",
		"The lieutenant observes you raising and lowering the toilet-water-logged mass under your nose, trying to get a good whiff. A good *analytical* whiff.",
		"\"Good, yes. We can return to the dead body -- by now it smells *exquisite*...\" Looks like he would rather concentrate on taking notes for now.",
		"The lieutenant clears his throat. \"I don't think this is the time to be going through personal affects,\" he says. \"Let's move on.\"",
		"\"Okay, good.\" There is a moment's silence. \"But *why*?\"",
		"\"Could we make it less *poetic* somehow? Just a normal case name, you know? Think -- what would that be? A good *normal* name?\"",
		"\"Now, if you'll excuse me...\" He reopens his own *pristine* blue notebook. \"That thing has filled me with the sudden urge to make sure mine is in *perfect* order.\"",
		"\"Officer, however damaged -- that...\" he points to it, \"...is still an official piece of paperwork. It probably contains notes on *numerous* ongoing investigations. It could even list undercover operatives. Certainly informants. I suggest integrating it into your *style*. For all our sakes.\"",
		"\"Know that I give this to you...\" He pulls one from the loop. \"...with *resentment*.\"",
		"\"Any capable light with the right wavelength will do.\"",
		"\"Thank you,\" the lieutenant nods. \"I think so too. Good and *normal*.\"",
		"The lieutenant looks at his blue notebook. *Two* fat, shiny pens hang from the binder, like large calibre bullets on an ammo belt.",
		"\"...but -- do you also use the *titular*?\"",
		"\"They're not going to *get* it. They're going to think: an idiot and a cock finger were on this case. So -- do you have something less *funny*?\"",
		"\"It's a holdover from the early days of the RCM -- right after the Revolution, when the organization had little idea how to do things. It persists in an *unofficial* capacity. Officers use these titles to refer to their work among themselves.\"",
		"\"Yes. And the belt around his neck; the hanging; even dragging him to the yard... *all* of it was done after this man was already dead.\"",
		"\"To hide something. The real killer? The real motivation? What really happened here.\"",
		"\"Oh.\" He nods. \"You *really, really* do. I am glad to hear you say that. Your room in the Whirling-in-Rags should come with a bathroom. Be sure to make use of it in the evening.\"",
		"\"There is no need. We have been thorough with the genitals...\" The lieutenant looks worried.",
		"\"Klaasje told us the bullet hit him in the *mouth* -- try putting your hand there...\"",
		"\"Only if *all else* fails,\" he stresses.",
		"\"We bag the corpse and carry him to the holding pen of my Kineema. I can transport him to Processing myself, but I *will* be gone for the rest of the day.\"",
		"\"Can you... can you get to it?\" He searches his pockets for something.",
		"He unrolls the plastic. \"I need a little help for carrying him to the holding pen of my Kineema. I'll take it from there.\"",
		"He closes his notebook and cracks his neck. \"Let's move. With every hour, whatever we're looking for in the deceased will become harder to find.\"",
		"With a *crack* he punches the knife in the skull. Then one more time -- and one more -- until the bone comes loose like eggshell. Inside you feel the jelly move from his poking. The object is still under your finger.",
		"\"We need to add an item to the injury list.\" He turns to his notebook. \"Injury #4: Oval entry wound with an abrasion collar. Soft palate, back of mouth.\"",
		"\"Good-good...\" The fridge in the background buzzes with excitement.",
		"\"...*this* injury here.\" He points to the mark encircling the corpse's neck.",
		"\"I have had this doubt since I inspected his hands, officer -- there were no signs of struggle. No claw marks on his neck. Why? Why didn't he fight for his life?\"",
		"\"To put him out of his misery?\" He thinks. \"It's possible, but it does not explain all the other dubious things here -- lack of struggle primarily. I may be intellectually sloppy, but I prefer one theory at a time. And this just smacks of treatment to me.\"",
		"\"Hey...\" A wide smile appears on his face. \"Wasn't there a *giant ice bear sarcophagus* below that building?\" He points toward the commercial area.",
		"\"Work on the case, tend to personal matters? Try not to do anything *too* dangerous. An officer needs backup in a neighbourhood like this.\"",
		"\"Unknown calibre. Rifled. Some kind of brittle alloy, fractured on impact...\"",
		"\"Mhm.\" He gets up. \"This is one task we *cannot* sideline. With every hour, whatever we're looking for will become harder to find.\"",
		"He frowns, thinking. \"Try putting your hand in his mouth and probing for the bullet in his *head*.\"",
		"The lieutenant answers with the sound of his pen on paper.",
		"\"A bullet.\" The lieutenant picks it up between his fingers. \"Unknown calibre. Rifled... you may remove your hand from the victim's head now, officer -- well done.\"",
		"\"No-no, you deserve it. We can log it later.\" The lieutenant drops the bag in your bloody hand. It feels light.",
		"\"That was then. This time we have extensive tissue destruction away from the wound track. This time we have a *bullet*.\"",
		"\"If you think so, officer.\" He nods. \"I am not going to object.\"",
		"\"Continue working here. The locals, the case, or tend to your own business? I will meet you downstairs in the Whirling-in-Rags, tomorrow morning -- 7:30 sharp.\"",
		"\"All right.\" He takes out a shiny black body bag and starts pulling the plastic over the dead man's face.",
		"\"Yes -- now. I've rarely been disappointed by the size of a *giant* ice bear fridge, but I think we should still take a look at it first. Make sure it's big *enough* before we carry him over.\"",
		"The lieutenant rubs his side for warmth. \"It'll come to you sooner or later. At least he's safe here until then.\"",
		"\"Work on the case, tend to personal matters? Try not to do anything too dangerous. An officer needs backup in a neighbourhood like this.\"",
		"\"As I said, treatment is an attempt to manipulate the body after death -- to hide the real cause with a *false* cause. In this case...\"",
		"\"Okay, well... We're in livor mortis here. He's disintegrating. We need to *refrigerate* the body, if we want to conduct another examination -- and we need to do it fast.\"",
		"\"Okay.\" He unrolls the plastic. \"I need a little help for carrying him to the holding pen of my Kineema. I can take care of the rest.\"",
		"\"Now that's an overstatement. It's not actually *for* storing cadavers, or at least I hope so. I think we should take a look at it first. Make sure it's big *enough* before we carry him over.\"",
		"Out comes his small folding knife -- the lieutenant moves its blade across the man's skull, searching for the exit wound...",
		"\"Can you push it out?\"",
		"\"High velocity, temporary cavity in brain tissue. Small exit wound on the occiput.\" He underlines the injury, forcefully. \"How does that sound?\"",
		"\"It would have to be *industrial* in size. Let's start by asking the proprietor of the Whirling-in-Rags, then the Frittte store down at the gates. And if neither has one...\" His voice trails off -- and his gaze settles on *Cuno*.",
		"He unrolls the plastic. \"I need a little help for carrying him to the holding pen of my Kineema. I'll take it from there.\"",
		"\"It's too late to take him into Processing today. I'll take him first thing tomorrow.\" He pulls the black plastic over the dead man's face.",
		"\"All right.\" He takes out a shiny black body bag and starts pulling the plastic over the dead man's face.",
		"\"Mhm,\" he agrees. \"Keep going.\"",
		"\"A bullet...\" The lieutenant puts a small bag marked *evidence* under it.",
		"\"There have been other signs too, small things. We were right not to assign hanging as cause of death. As the perpetrators *expected* we would -- no such luck for them.\"",
		"\"All right.\" He takes out a shiny black body bag and starts pulling the plastic over the dead man's face.",
		"\"I can drive him to Processing today, no problem. Since we stalled with this... But this *does* mean I will be gone for the rest of the day.\"",
		"\"Wait, detective!\" Just as you start to slide your fingers out...",
		"\"Now, detective... I've rarely been disappointed by the size of a *giant* ice bear fridge, but I think we should still take a look at it first. Make sure it's big *enough* before we carry him over.\"",
		"\"I see it...\" The lieutenant looks in. There's a pen in his hand. His notebook is open at the red pages.",
		"\"Don't be silly.\" A smile comes across his face. \"You've earned it. Consider the binoclard episode forgotten.\" The lieutenant drops the bag in your bloody hand. It feels light.",
		"\"Deadady-dead-dead.\"",
		"\"I did not *just* come up with this. I've had my doubts since we found no signs of struggle on his wrists. No claw marks on his neck -- why? Why didn't he fight for his life?\"",
		"He shakes his head. \"I worked as one of these *Processing guys* for a year. They are butchers and clowns. I once saw twenty CODs go misidentified in one week. Chances are slim to none that they'll find anything useful in processing.\"",
		"\"We put him in a bag and carry him to the holding pen of my Kineema. The bodybag should contain the odour for the duration of the transport...\"",
		"\"Of course. You've *earned* it.\" The lieutenant drops the bag in your bloody hand. It feels light.",
		"\"There have been other signs too, small details. Everything is too neatly designed for us to assign probable cause here. As we did, foolhardily. Well -- no more.\"",
		"\"All right.\" He takes out a shiny black body bag and starts pulling the plastic over the dead man's face.",
		"\"Hurry. This is one task we *cannot* sideline. With every hour, whatever we're looking for will become harder to find.\"",
		"\"One more thing -- this was *really* good work, detective.\"",
		"\"Do you think we missed something?\"",
		"He nods. \"I had my doubts --  there were no signs of a struggle on his hands. No claw marks on his neck. But still...\"",
		"\"Yes. We should take a closer look at it. I am certain it has more to tell us.\"",
		"\"We have the makings of a... very small exit wound here.\" The lieutenant leans closer.",
		"\"That's for us to find out. But *this* -- it will make finding them just a little easier.\"",
		"Meanwhile, the lieutenant is sitting behind his desk, hunched over a stack of paperwork. His help would be invaluable right now.",
		"\"Here's your prize.\" He drops the bullet in an evidence bag and puts it in your hand -- your other hand, the one *not* covered in blood and cerebral cortex.",
		"\"Treatment, officer, is an attempt to manipulate the body after death -- to hide the real cause with a *false* cause. In this case...\"",
		"\"If you want for this task to slowly become impossible, then yes. Otherwise -- no. He's been *hanging out* far too long already. We need to ice him.\"",
		"\"If the Hardies are to be trusted, there should be a bullet in there...\" The lieutenant looks at you. \"Try putting your hand in his mouth and probing for the bullet in his head.\"",
		"\"I will need a little help carrying him -- you take the hands, I'll take the legs.\"",
		"\"Mhm. Withdraw your hand 4 centimetres please.\"",
		"\"I have had my doubts for a while now. Since I saw there were no signs of struggle on his hands. And no claw marks on his neck...\"",
		"\"And, if we are to believe Hardie boys, it's somewhere in there...\"",
		"\"Opinion -- fatal injury.\"",
		"\"We have *extensive* tissue destruction away from the wound track -- we have a *bullet*.\"",
		"\"In short, you and I are the *last* line of detection. If you're not sure we got everything, we need to look *again*. And for that -- we need to refrigerate the corpse.\"",
		"\"I *would* drive him to Processing, but it's too late to do that today... I'll do it first thing tomorrow. No problem.\"",
		"The bullet falls in the bag leaving a smattering of blood on the plastic. He raises the bag under his eyes and says:",
		"\"And one last thing.\" *Click-click* goes the pen. \"We can now fill in injury #3: ligament mark. Opinion -- non-fatal, post-mortem: *treatment*.\"",
		"\"Klaasje told us the bullet hit him in the mouth -- try putting your hand there...\"",
		"\"I'll leave that choice to you. And one more thing...\" He looks you in the eye. \"Great work, detective.\"",
		"\"Okay.\" He unrolls the plastic. \"I need a little help for carrying him to the holding pen of my Kineema. I can take care of the rest.\"",
		"\"Just look at those details. So much effort...\"",
		"The lieutenant can't help but comment: \"An inordinate amount of time has gone into drawing these little welkin creatures...\"",
		"\"Mhm... political commentary. That one has a great beard too...\" The lieutenant nods at the welkin's facial hair.",
		"\"Looks like they didn't make it.\" The lieutenant looks at the frigid ice field of nothingness.",
		"\"This looks like *concept art* for a project. It's not really real.\"",
		"\"Some people really *like* building a world, I think. Even if it's just for a game.\"",
		"\"Another radiocomputer...\" says the lieutenant, watching you circle around the machine. \"Just sitting here without anyone in sight.\"",

		"\"How about you share your information on the lynching -- now that you've seen his badge.\"",
		"\"But the strike began in *December*.\" He looks at his notes.",
		"\"And when did you first arrive?\"",
		"\"Of course, ma'am. We should have introduced ourselves...\" The lieutenant hands her a piece of blue plastic. \"I'm Lieutenant Kitsuragi, from Precinct 57...\"",
		"\"I'm afraid my partner doesn't shake hands. Please don't take offence.\"",
		"\"Don't worry. He'll be *fine*. It's all related to his unusual medical episode.\" He opens his notebook. \"Continue, please. He has questions.\"",
		"\"And this is my colleague from Precinct 41.\" He waits for you to show your badge.",
		"\"It is a little known fact among those who *police* that the Wayfarer Act specifically denies the RCM the authority to demand anyone's operator license.\"",
		"\"Actually,\" the lieutenant becomes defensive, \"that motor carriage has been specially issued to serve as a patrol and *pursuit* vehicle.\"",
		"\"No need to politicize this. You may still ask for the lady's *passport*.\"",
		"\"I told you his methods are... unconventional.\"",
		"\"It appears we're being monitored every step we take, colleague.\" The lieutenant shrugs. \"Did we have any other business here?\"",
		"\"Ideas like this one are all part of his rare medical condition, ma'am. Nothing to be worried about.\"",
		"Don't tell her you've met Evrart *right away*. There's time.",
		"The lieutenant breathes a sigh of relief. \"Good. We won't be needing to go to my Kineema, then.\"",
		"\"And this is my colleague from Precinct 41.\" He points to you. \"I'm afraid he doesn't have his badge at the moment. I hope mine will suffice.\"",
		"\"As I said, ma'am,\" the lieutenant interjects, \"his technique may be *very* unconventional. But he *is* an officer of the RCM.\"",
		"\"I understand the dictates of protocol, ma'am, but... is there no way around it?\"",
		"\"Wild Pines seems to be *well apprised* of the local drug trade, ma'am. Do you mean to say the Union also *produces* the product? Sells drugs, I mean?\"",
		"\"*If* there is an investigation it will be part of an ongoing operation -- subject to confidentiality. I am sure you understand.\"",
		"\"My colleague has his peculiarities. Let's not go into this particular one just yet.\"",
		"\"Actually, you don't.\"",
		"\"Detective, may I remind you that Mrs. Messier is a *professional negotiator*?\" He doesn't look like he thinks you'll best her in single combat.",
		"\"The thoughts happen *inside* his brain,\" the lieutenant explains.",
		"\"Don't worry. He'll be *fine*. It's all part of his unusual medical condition.\" He opens his notebook. \"Continue, please. He has questions.\"",
		"\"... unusual medical episode.\"",
		"The lieutenant clears his throat audibly.",
		"\"His medical condition makes him a little *grumpy*, ma'am. I hope that's not a problem.\"",
		"\"And this is my colleague from Precinct 41, Detective Du Bois.\" He points to you. \"I'm afraid Harry doesn't have his badge at the moment. I hope mine will suffice.\"",
		"\"Except he isn't.\"",
		"\"What the ma'am means is that the Emergencies Act and the RCM both get their authority from the Coalition Government.\"",
		"\"This may seem like *odd* behaviour for a police officer, ma'am, but it's a perfectly common side effect of his...\" He squints at you.",
		"\"Why I had to call East Motor Tract -- and *beg* them to open the drawbridge for me. I'd wondered since I first drove *in*. On my motor carriage.\"",
		"\"I'm enjoying this part of the interview -- it has *so* little to do with the murder we're investigating.\"",
		"\"No, he's not. Our friend here has quite the sense of humour, part of his technique, you see?\"",
		"He looks at you expectantly. Then it dawns on him...",
		"\"And how are the talks going?\"",
		"\"This isn't the first time the Union has gone on strike?\"",
		"\"That is good to hear, madam.\" He opens his notebook. \"My colleague will take the lead on this interview. I should let you know that he's recovering from an *unusual* medical episode -- *very* unusual -- but I can assure you of his ultimate competency.\"",
		"\"Disappeared?\"",
		"\"Thank you for your concern, ma'am. We'll be just fine.\"",
		"\"I was just being polite -- even schoolchildren know the Wayfarer Act.\"",
		"\"Detective,\" the lieutenant closes his notebook. \"A word in private before we continue.\"",
		"\"There was a shakedown of local businesses preceding the strike. Many were squeezed to bankruptcy to fund it.\"",
		"\"The Wayfarer Act specifically denies the RCM the authority to demand anyone's operator license. It's a *little known fact* among us law officials.\"",
		"\"Unless it's their *passport*, no. Do you want to ask for the lady's passport?\"",
		"\"You're right, ma'am, that donations are permitted under the Emergency Act, unseemly as it may be, as long as they're properly logged with the precinct...\"",
		"The lieutenant's stone-like face remains impassive, yet in his eyes -- a flash of reproach.",
		"\"No matter, detective. We're losing the thread again.\"",
		"\"Well -- at least this solves *one* mystery.\"",
		"\"Excuse me,\" the lieutenant looks up from his notes, \"From whom did you *hear* about this lynching?\"",
		"\"Or not -- though if you have evidence to the contrary I'm *eager* to hear it.\"",
		"\"It's for crossing long distances in the Greater Revachol Industrial Harbour. It's not a toy.\"",
		"\"And this is my colleague from Precinct 41, Detective Du Bois.\" He waits for you to show your badge.",
		"\"No need to resort to self pity, detective. You can still ask for her passport.\"",
		"\"A mob,\" the lieutenant says succinctly. \"The Débardeurs are a crime syndicate. Sad as it may be, we're forced to cooperate with them.\"",
		"\"We know the company has launched its own probe into the Union's alleged involvement -- we also know it's come up empty. It's not just the RCM -- *no one's* been able to find any hard evidence.\"",
		"\"Ingredients for *what*, ma'am?\"",
		"Yes -- I should decide.",
		"He looks at you expectantly. Then it dawns on him...",
		"\"This does not come as news to us, but still...\" He exchanges a glance with you. \"To *your* knowledge, where did this assault take place? If you know.\"",
		"\"*Every worker*...\"",
		"\"What next?\"",
		"\"For all your talk of averting this catastrophe, the situation at the gates is a powder keg. Does this not bother you?\"",
		"\"And that seems to corroborate the ethnicity we gave.\" The lieutenant is pedantically happy about it.",
		"The lieutenant cuts in: \"What would you say was his eye colour -- the deceased's?\"",
		"\"Since you're sharing, ma'am -- this is also the RCM's worst case scenario.\"",
		"\"It appears you've found it, yes. And I'm not happy for you.\"",
		"\"Do you know a lot about the inner workings of the RCM and the ICP, ma'am?\"",
		"\"Where is your radio, for contacting them -- if I may ask? Do you have an ear piece?\"",
		"The lieutenant consults his notebook, his eyebrows knitted in concentration...",
		"\"Ma'am, with all due respect -- I've been around Martinaise and there's a giant hulk of a man in ill-fitting clothes at the harbour gates. Mr. 'Right to Work.' His heart *really* isn't in it.\"",
		"\"Meaning they're used to operating in war zones.\"",
		"\"That's alright, ma'am. Anything else -- nationality? What would you say was his age?\"",
		"\"Indeed. This matches the dental reconstruction we saw on the body,\" he says to you, then turns back to Joyce. \"What else? Nationality? Accent?\"",
		"\"So what happened?\"",
		"\"We will be careful, ma'am.\"",
		"\"What else? Nationality? Accent?\"",
		"\"What is the nature of this so-called investigation?\"",
		"\"Odd... we haven't heard any reports about an *assault* in connection with the lynching. Where did it take place? And when?\"",
		"\"Your concern may be appearances. Ours is keeping the peace.\"",
		"\"What is the purpose of this, detective?\"",
		"\"Who are they, exactly?\"",
		"\"Whether to execute one, some, or all of the Union militants.\"",
		"\"It was taken with a Trigat, not long ago. This is the man's upper body. There were no more markings on his hands or legs.\"",
		"The lieutenant jots something down in his notebook, muttering to himself: \"Had him down as Mondial... should change it to Occidental.\"",
		"\"Occidental... that fits the statement of another witness,\" the lieutenant says, pleased.",
		"\"The Débardeurs have over two thousand men. It will be a thousand to one.\"",
		"\"You said you can't read it.\"",
		"\"They don't report their progress to you?\"",
		"\"Did you miss the part about *ceramic armour* and *automatic weapons*, detective?\"",
		"\"And the other must be in one of the four-story buildings overlooking the roundabout. He or she was reporting back to you while we were canvassing the lorry drivers.\"",
		"\"The position of my *unusual* colleague does not reflect official policy. I hope you understand -- the RCM does not pick sides.\"",
		"\"I've seen the Union's forces. They're better organized than these mercenaries. They also have the support of the people of Revachol West.\"",
		"\"I am sure you have the money. The question is how many years and how many lives are you willing to sacrifice?\"",
		"A barely perceptible nod.",
		"The lieutenant watches her boat grow smaller on the bay, its white sails fluttering.",
		"The lieutenant does not say anything, but you hear the nylon of his jacket rustle as he looks at you.",
		"\"We do for this, officer.\"",
		"\"In all good humour -- that was a donation. It has been registered and it will yield you no favours.\" He nods. \"Another thing --\"",
		"\"The RCM does not pick sides in this, madam. I hope it doesn't come off any other way.\"",
		"\"It will take more than Krenel to wipe them out. Wild Pines will need to send more and better-equipped men. Make no mistake, ma'am...\"",
		"\"And if it *were* a conflict, the RCM would not pick sides. My colleague's *unusual* approach to police work does not represent the organization at this time.\"",
		"The lieutenant looks at you and you can swear his jaw muscle is trembling.",
		"The lieutenant looks at his own watch and sighs. \"Maybe so, detective, but that doesn't mean we're not obliged to try and stop it.\"",
		"\"Unconventional police officers sometimes *lose* their guns. They then go around and tell people about this -- to gauge their reactions. It's all part of *detecting*.\"",
		"\"I do not want to shoot myself in the head.\" She tugs on the rope.",
		"\"How far along is Krenel's *investigation*?\"",
		"\"Detective, I advise you to be *very* selective with what information you choose to share. This may have consequences beyond our line-of-sight.\"",
		"\"Frankly, what was done was not pretty at all -- but neither was it illegal. And it was not for nothing.\" He turns to you...",
		"\"Don't worry madam. I am very sane.\"",
		"\"One that has apparently driven local shops out of business.\"",
		"\"Ma'am... This may well unravel property law this side of the river. If that occurs, we may never see the end of this kind of confrontation. The next time there will be two strikes...\" He looks toward the harbour. \"Then four, then a hundred.\"",
		"\"Truly, but that's how he operates. He just does things, ma'am. And then talks about them -- even if it's inappropriate.\"",
		"\"I advise you to be *very* selective with what information you choose to share. This may have consequences beyond our line-of-sight.\"",
		"\"We cannot discuss the specifics of an ongoing investigation, ma'am.\" The lieutenant adjusts his glasses. \"Besides, you haven't exactly been forthcoming yourself...\"",
		"\"The RCM does not pick sides in this. I hope it doesn't come off any other way.\"",
		"\"There's always that risk, ma'am. But if I may offer my opinion...\"",
		"\"Please don't get him in a loop. If he gets in a loop it will last *forever*. Ask him to say something else please.\"",
		"So does the lieutenant. His mouth is slightly open as he looks to the sky.",
		"The lieutenant narrows his eyes.",
		"\"Yes, detective -- what *were* you hoping to accomplish with this strange thing?\"",
		"\"One day you will realize you can't simply go around saying these things about the citizens we're here to protect.\"",
		"\"The gangs will run wild.\" The lieutenant keeps his hand in the rain. \"Jacking motor carriages, ferrying amphetamines through Coal City. Spring is tough in Revachol.\"",
		"\"That's right, detective. And next time you should confer with them before you go setting events in motion.\"",
		"\"Officer...\" The look on the lieutenant's face conveys uncertainty. He doesn't even sound angry.",
		"\"He means it.\"",
		"\"You're wrong, detective. And next time you should confer with those superiors before you go setting events in motion.\"",
		"\"We're not at liberty to discuss that ma'am.\"",
		"\"You're right detective -- that whole undertaking was *very* unimportant. Why did we do it?\"",
		"\"This has been informative, thank you ma'am. I'm sure my memory-impaired partner has *many* more questions to ask...\" He turns to you. \"...about even more fundamental aspects of reality...\"",
		"\"Of course not,\" He shakes his head. \"You're *already* diligent for getting this far -- and diligent boys remember where they left off.\"",
		"\"Yes!\" The lieutenant takes a step closer to you, rubbing his hands together. \"There is a *stranger* reason, isn't there?\"",
		"\"Hmh,\" the lieutenant hums, reading his notes.",
		"\"Seditious talk, ma'am.\" The lieutenant puts down his notes and gives her a look.",
		"\"Yes,\" the lieutenant looks at his watch. \"Also, I think we've had enough excitement for today. We *do* have a case to attend to.\"",
		"\"Good.\" The lieutenant returns. \"He has not passed out from it. Perhaps I worried for nothing... Are we still on the reality low-down -- or should we do actual policework now?\"",
		"\"Might I suggest *not* asking them all right now? Ma'am Messier will be here later too. And tomorrow. Isn't that true, ma'am?\"",
		"\"You will find him a big fan of the *ancient ways* -- it's part of his *condition*.\"",
		"\"All three are good to know,\" the lieutenant looks up from his notes, \"when we're out *policing*.\"",
		"\"That's *somewhat* of an exaggeration,\" the lieutenant interjects. \"In reality, ours is a mutually beneficial arrangement.\"",
		"\"Ma'am.\" He turns to her again. \"Remember, you're dealing with a very *sensitive* and *impressionable* police officer who is still recovering from a recent medical episode.\"",
		"\"Yes, well...\" he thinks. \"The rest of us have dealt with it for thousands of years, so...\" He looks around, a little uncomfortable now.",
		"\"You will find he doesn't approve of foreign wisdom. It's part of his *condition*.\"",
		"The lieutenant observes you both, silently. He adjusts his glasses.",
		"The lieutenant glances at you from the corner of his eye.",
		"\"Yes!\" The lieutenant takes a step closer to you, rubbing his hands together. \"There is a *stranger* reason, isn't there?\"",
		"\"Yes,\" the lieutenant steps in to make a gesture encompassing you both: \"*We* are the Revachol Citizens Militia.\"",
		"\"Yes.\" The lieutenant takes a step closer to you. \"Why don't you tell Mrs. Messier what you told me, hm?\"",
		"A frisson lifts the hair on the back of your arm. Wind sweeps the surface of the bay.",
		"\"Fine.\" He steps away with his notes.",
		"\"Yes, *all* of them.\"",
		"\"Good.\" The lieutenant returns. \"You have not passed out from it. Perhaps I worried for nothing... Are we still on the reality low-down -- or should we do actual policework now?\"",
		"\"My reality-impaired colleague is not so far off...\" The lieutenant wanders back into the conversation -- he's been sorting his notes.",
		"\"That is understandable -- but *perhaps* it's better not to eat all your candy at once?\"",
		"\"Don't be fazed, madam. He functions perfectly well. He only needs a... *lowdown* on all of reality.\"",
		"\"You will find that *most* things concern the coming apocalypse. It's part of his *condition*.\"",
		"\"Revacholians get to keep the peace in Revachol, and the Coalition doesn't have to worry about it...\" He coughs. \"Anyway, sorry to intrude. Please continue.\"",
		"\"But I did. Anyway...\" He looks around, a little uncomfortable now.",
		"\"Many of the RCM's fashions, even weapon preferences, borrow heavily from classic Vespertine cop shows. My precinct alone has three officers who go by the name *Ace*...\"",
		"\"Good.\" The lieutenant returns. \"He has not passed out from it. Perhaps I worried for nothing... Are we still on the reality low-down -- or should we do actual policework now?\"",
		"He nods. \"It's better not to eat all your candy at once.\"",
		"\"Except the ones who are philosophers.\"",
		"\"Yes.\" The lieutenant takes a step closer to you. \"Why don't you tell Mrs. Messier what you told me, hmh?\"",
		"\"We *are*.\"",
		"\"We've been through this -- ask something else or let's return to work.\"",
		"\"Are they now?\" The lieutenant cocks one eyebrow.",
		"\"Naturally,\" he nods.",
		"\"Fine.\" He steps away with his notes.",
		"\"Good.\" The lieutenant returns. \"You have not passed out from it. Perhaps I worried for nothing... Are we still on the reality low-down -- or should we do actual policework now?\"",
		"\"Except the ones who are detectives.\"",
		"\"Ma'am.\" He turns to her again. \"This philosophical police detective is very *sensitive* and *impressionable* because of his recent medical episode.\"",
		"\"Don't be fazed, madam. He functions perfectly well. He only needs a... *lowdown* on all of reality.\"",
		"\"But please -- do continue this reality-exploration. I was just remarking.\"",
		"\"This does not represent the official RCM opinion,\" the lieutenant says from behind his notes.",
		"\"Or -- you could *not* eat all the candy at once, let the ma'am rest for a while, and return to this later?\"",
		"\"My position, ma'am? My parents got ripped to shreds in the Revolution -- I would have gone the same way. I was saved by being two years old. That's my position -- the abattoir.\"",
		"\"Khm.\" The lieutenant puts down his notes for a moment. \"Opinions expressed here do not reflect the official position of the RCM.\"",
		"\"It was a kerfuffle all right,\" the lieutenant mumbles from behind his notes.",
		"\"*Just dock workers*? Do dock workers spy on the Police? We let you off easy, miss. Don't think it will happen again.\"",
		"\"Hmh...\" The lieutenant is not satisfied with the approach.",
		"\"You seem a little different today. Less hospitable.\"",
		"\"Hmh. So you were spying on us. And now you represent murder suspects -- *just dock workers*.\"",
		"\"Do dock workers spy on the Police? You were on that corner all day. Now we know why.\" He smiles: \"Just dock workers...\"",
		"\"It doesn't matter if you recognize our authority. We will make an arrest if we have to.\"",
		"\"We've talked to Evrart Claire. We know who these men are. The Union's *militant* wing.\"",
		"\"Calm down everyone. Let's stay professional.\"",
		"\"I think we'll *keep* sticking around, Titus. You'll be surprised at how quickly a theory presents itself if you keep looking.\"",
		"\"Understood -- you've listened in on their communications.\" He takes a little note. \"How long?\"",
		"\"I think we'll keep sticking around, Titus. We haven't even talked to the company rep yet -- we should do that,\" he turns to you. \"She's on the pier I believe... northwest.\"",
		"\"I'm sure we can find a tape player. It's not a problem,\" he repeats calmly in a hushed voice.",
		"\"Wh-why would you say that?\" He turns to Titus. \"Ruby is just the next logical link in the investigation. If we can talk to her we can *eliminate* her as a suspect.\"",
		"\"We're looking for Titus Hardie.\" The lieutenant turns to the broad-shouldered man at the end of the table.",
		"\"Detective.\" The lieutenant acknowledges you with a sharp note. He's leaving it to you.",
		"\"Listen. She wasn't raped.\" The lieutenant's voice is beginning to betray his agitation. \"The witness' statements were very clear.\"",
		"\"She wasn't raped.\" The lieutenant's voice is beginning to betray his agitation. \"The witness' statements were very clear.\"",
		"\"Ruby is missing. If you hide from the police in a murder investigation you become a suspect. You know how it works, guys.\"",
		"\"Maybe the Wild Pines has help to offer if they won't? Maybe not. Either way -- we'll have a case against your Ruby soon enough.\"",
		"\"I'm sure we can find a tape player,\" the lieutenant whispers.",
		"\"He's the real deal, he has a badge.\"",
		"\"He's the real deal.\"",
		"\"He's the real deal, he has a gun now.\"",
		"\"I'm not your partner.\" He says quickly. \"This... this union is temporary.\"",
		"\"We're getting to it... There have been complications.\"",
		"The lieutenant goes pale. 'No badge?' he mouths to himself silently.",
		"The lieutenant merely bows his head in response.",
		"\"It's an urban myth,\" the lieutenant says quietly. \"About an officer who is so far undercover he can't remember who he is. As I said -- just an urban myth. *You're* not the Son of Lung.\"",
		"\"I fear...\" The lieutenant lowers his voice. \"I fear you're misinterpreting this situation.\"",
		"The lieutenant is silent.",
		"\"No, he doesn't.\"",
		"\"Mkm.\" He shakes his head. \"I'm not getting involved in this.\"",
		"\"What are you planning to do, throw a dinner party? Please refrain from culinary experiments until after we've finished the investigation.\"",
		"\"There was a barred door on the roof that did *not* have a lock -- perhaps there is one *downstairs* that does?\" He looks around. \"We should search the *kitchen*.\"",
		"\"It's for the blue door in the kitchen -- the note inside said the workshop key is behind the window. This is that key.\" He makes a note in his blue notebook.",
		"\"It's for the blue door in the kitchen. There was a note there that you missed. It said the workshop key is behind the window. It's this key.\" He makes a note in his blue notebook.",
		"\"It *could* open the door in the kitchen -- the blue door.\" He looks at the key in your hand. \"It says 'Workshop, Spare' -- maybe there's a workshop there?\"",
		"\"If he says it's there, it's there.\" The lieutenant takes his glasses off to clean them -- then puts them back on.",
		"\"It says... 'Workshop, Spare'.\" He looks at the key in your hand. \"There's a door in the *kitchen* that caught my eye yesterday -- it's very *blue*. Maybe there's a workshop behind it?\"",
		"\"Indeed. Neither do I.\"",
		"\"No. On the contrary, this whole room could be very useful if we could read it.\" He looks down the stairs. \"Maybe later.\"",
		"The lieutenant leans closer. \"You're thinking -- what if the shot didn't come from the roof?\"",
		"\"It's a weakness,\" he admits after a pause, looking in the direction of the stairs.",
		"\"It also looks like there may be more to her skill set than we know. The question is -- should we trust her?\"",
		"\"Yes, but it'll take them days to give it to us.\"",
		"\"I find that hard to believe. But at this point... what difference does it make?\"",
		"\"I'm not exactly sure either, to be honest. My imagination has a way of failing me.\"",
		"The lieutenant sighs, looking into the cold distance across the water...",
		"\"It would be the *diligent* thing to do. Until then -- personally -- I'm going with the roof version. A simple hypothesis can be wrong, but it's something to build on.\"",
		"\"She was there that night -- she would have known precisely where the bullet hole was in the glass...\"",
		"The lieutenant looks out the window and onto the bay.",
		"\"Ah... Yes, of course. The village. Let's go.\"",
		"\"No-no. We're onto something... We should come back with a map and compare the landscape to the radius of the shot.\"",
		"\"I see you have given this a lot of thought,\" he remarks, raising an eyebrow. \"Are those the locations you've singled out, in addition to the roof? And what is the likelihood, in your opinion, that it came from a further distance?\"",
		"\"This is ballistics. She's left a trajectory for us...\" The lieutenant tests the thread with his finger. Drawn taut, it rebounds instantly.",
		"\"I don't know. At this point...\" He stops mid-sentence.",
		"\"No. I just don't want to walk into another *embarrassment*. I am a creature of pride, you see...\" There is silence. \"I'm afraid of becoming a joke.\"",
		"\"There was a map in the bookstore. We should come back with it, compare the landscape to the radius of the shot.\"",
		"\"I understand.\"",
		"\"Could be the makings of a sniper's nest...\" He nods.",
		"\"We need to do ballistics on this -- understand where the shot came from once and for all.\"",
		"\"Okay.\"",
		"\"Good. We should come back with the map and compare the landscape to the radius of the shot.\"",
		"Following your lead, the lieutenant leans in closer to inspect the surface.",
		"\"So it is.\"",
		"\"Okay, let's go to the fucking island.\" He takes a second to gather himself, then says...",
		"\"No. There's nothing else...\" He sighs, looking into the cold distance across the water.",
		"\"It's not impossible.\" He nods. \"There is a narrow opening between the commercial area and the collapsed tenement north of it...\"",
		"\"It is.\" The lieutenant touches the window. \"We're beating our heads against this -- let's go do something more useful.\"",
		"\"Not a lot, no.\"",
		"\"Maybe -- there were boats there. We should ask around. Let's go.\"",
		"\"This is ballistics. She's left a trajectory for us...\" The lieutenant tests the thread with his finger. Drawn taut, it rebounds instantly.",
		"\"Of course.\" He nods. \"Of course I'm in.\" He takes a second to gather himself, then says...",
		"\"We could ask around in the fishing village. They had boats.\"",
		"\"Unless she thinks the perpetrator was standing *on* the ring antenna, that is where the thread seems to point.\" He nods.",
		"\"Okay. Well, we should see if there is gunshot residue or sniper nests if we go down the coast. Rule these spots out -- one by one.\"",
		"\"From where, precisely?\"",
		"\"I just haven't gotten a lot of sleep these past few days.\"",
		"\"How do we get there? Joyce Messier had her sloop, but she's gone.\"",
		"\"I remember.\" He looks out the window and onto the bay.",
		"\"Looks like it, yes.\" He adjusts his glasses.",
		"\"No-no. We're onto something... There was a map in the bookstore. We should come back with it, compare the landscape to the radius of the shot.\"",
		"\"No. You're right. We have to go to the island. Pardon me, the concussion...\" He takes a second to gather himself, then says...",
		"\"The bookstore. They have maps.\" The lieutenant leans closer. \"You're thinking what if the shot didn't come from the roof, right?\"",
		"\"To the workshop behind the wall.\" He points somewhere within. \"This must be the barred door we saw -- we *could* return and open it from the inside.\" He looks at the door with suspicion.",
		"\"It is not the first closed door we've found in this building -- there is also your mysterious blue kitchen door.\"",
		"\"The vigilantes, the cadaver, and...\" He nods toward the young woman. \"A number of people connected to the case are *in* or around this building. This door is part of it. It's not *unimportant*.\"",
		"\"I don't know. The further we get, the more this building seems to be tied to the case...\"",
		"\"I don't see how this is going to give new results.\" He measures the door, stoically. \"There must be another way in there.\"",
		"\"I don't see how this is going to give new results.\" He measures the door, stoically. \"There must be another way in there.\"",
		"\"Through the kitchen door, perhaps? Let's explore, rather than destroy.\"",
		"\"The door has withstood your *demolishing* attempts.\" He measures the door, stoically. \"There must be another way in.\"",
		"\"No -- still a mini-investigation.\" He pretends to make a note in his notebook.",
		"\"It's the barred door we saw.\" He looks at the door with suspicion. \"I don't know why we didn't open it from the inside -- we *should*.\"",
		"\"I hate it when that happens.\"",
		"\"We should search downstairs, in the kitchen -- just in case. Maybe there's a door that leads up, that we don't know of.\"",
		"\"I don't know about that...\" The lieutenant smiles an uncomfortable smile.",
		"\"I don't know.\" He makes a note in his notebook.",
		"\"Let's not.\"",
		"\"The vigilantes, the cadaver, and...\" He nods to where they young woman once stood. \"A number of people connected to the case are *in* or around this building. This door is part of it. It's not *unimportant*.\"",
		"\"Sounds like the property damage wasn't in vain, at least. Would it hurt to look in?\"",
		"\"We should search downstairs. There are things about this building we don't know yet.\"",
		"He doesn't say anything.",
		"\"The further we get, the more this building seems to be tied to the case...\"",
		"\"It must be connected to the room we found behind the kitchen door. Maybe we should go back and take that elevator up...\" He looks at the door with suspicion.",
		"The lieutenant gives you an acknowledging little nod.",
		"That's not entirely true, the lieutenant is looking at the door to the east and mostly misses them.",
		"\"Look on the bright side: if it fails, we will only sustain minor injuries. I'm talking three, maybe four months in the hospital. Maximum five.\"",
		"\"Seems like a small freight elevator for transporting machinery. For that -- it's pretty quaint.\" He taps the on the guttering light bulb -- it's golden in the dark.",
		"\"If some form of time travel becomes possible in the future, I doubt its inventors will use it to repair elevators in Martinaise,” the lieutenant responds with a grave voice.",
		"\"No, I think the bureaucrats just forgot about this back-room elevator after the Revolution.\"",
		"\"Seems so, although it's pretty... quaint for a freight elevator.\" He taps on the guttering light bulb -- it's golden in the dark.",
		"\"No, it was maintained in '88 of the *previous* century.\"",
		"\"At the end of the last century.\" He nods. \"Look on the bright side. If it fails, we will only sustain minor injuries -- I'm talking three, maybe four months in the hospital. maximum five.\"",
		"\"That it does.\" The lieutenant peeks in. \"I say -- let's brave it.\"",
		"\"It is *lame*.\"",
		"\"Not only to you -- I am *Lieutenant Kitsuragi* to everyone.\" He nods. \"Now -- we really need to continue our sweep of what appears to be a secret path through the Whirling.\"",
		"\"No. You're *gonna* call me Lieutenant Kitsuragi -- or on rare occasions 'Kim', because it's shorter.\" He nods. \"Let's go.\"",
		"\"It's best if *you* handle the juvenile delinquents,\" he nods.",
		"\"Okay.\" He thinks for a moment. \"I don't like pinball because I had to learn to play it for an undercover job at a pinball ring. And it's a lame, boring, and unchallenging game -- there. We can move on now.\"",
		"\"So *now* he remembers...\" He looks at you in the silence of the workshop -- then takes his glasses off and cleans them.",
		"\"Wonderful. He *only* remembers hearing about the *pinball policeman*.\"",
		"\"I am not *called* Pinball. It was used to taunt me -- a long time ago. *Before* I became a homicide detective. And got my lieutenancy.\"",
		"\"But even *I* know that they don't play pinball. They have a rigid class society, and a punitive justice system...\" He looks around. \"We should continue with our exploration of this place. It doesn't matter.\"",
		"\"Okay.\" He thinks for a moment. \"I don't like pinball because I had to learn to play it for an undercover job at a pinball ring. And it's a lame, boring, and unchallenging game -- there. We can move on now.\"",
		"\"No.\"",
		"\"You can't *fire* them up, they're broken. Only that one machine in the main hall works. The Royalist Pinball.\" He looks away.",
		"\"Lieutenant Kitsuragi is good too.\" He nods. \"Now -- we really need to continue our sweep of what appears to be a secret path through the Whirling.\"",
		"\"Fine. I'm Kim 'Pinball' Kitsuragi.\" he puts them back on. \"AKA The Kimball. You remembered -- congratulations.\"",
		"\"End of story.\"",
		"\"Unbelievably,\" he nods. \"To do that I needed to become a... *pinball champion*. I trained for nine months. The job was successful and I was moved out of the juvenile wing -- to homicide.\"",
		"\"Us *guys*?\"",
		"\"What?\"",
		"\"No, I love it -- I love pinball. Who doesn't love pinball? Let's move on.\"",
		"\"It was not okay. I needed to become a... *pinball champion*.\" He shudders. \"I trained for 9 months. The job was successful and I was moved out of the juvenile wing -- to homicide.\"",
		"\"No human being should. It is a game that requires no skill and a childlike affinity to flashing lights. And to *fantastique*, science fiction, and historic romance franchises.\"",
		"He puts his glasses back on. \"Fine. I was a juvenile police officer -- for over 15 years. It's how I started out in the RCM. Once I had to infiltrate a pinball ring. As you do -- when you're a juvie cop.\"",
		"\"Some kind of...\" He looks around, thinking. \"Inane pinball theme -- probably related to Messina during the Dolorian age. The *history themes* are the worst.\"",
		"\"Seol is an *extremely* protectionist isola, inaccessible to the rest of mankind. As it has been for over a thousand years. I have no special knowledge of them, despite my heritage.\"",
		"\"No. *They're* not -- let's move on. There's more to this place than pinball machines.\"",
		"\"That time is over now.\" He looks at the pinball machine and breathes in. \"I was already a 38 year old man. It was unbecoming. As was playing pinball.\"",
		"He leans closer to inspect the peephole. \"You can barely see through. Better not to jump to *sensationalist* conclusions here.\"",
		"\"The footprints on the floor, however...\" He points to the marks nearby, on the floor. \"*Definitely* suspicious.\"",
		"\"Looks like it. I'm guessing Martinaise North 22 used to be a pinball arcade before it became a hostel. There are machines left over...\" He taps his foot.",
		"\"Ah, yes -- as the novelty dicemaker said.\" He makes a note in his notebook. \"This has absolutely nothing to do with the case, I'm sure. But I do like a nice little *connection*.\"",
		"The lieutenant looks around the dusty, crowded room, inspecting the tools on the shelf.",
		"\"If that's true then our *cafeteria manager* is not going to like it.\" He looks around. \"We should tell him what we found up here -- *omitting* that suspicion.\"",
		"\"He does not appear to be the kind of man who likes his establishment to be part of a neighbourhood ghost story. About *bankruptcy*.\"",
		"\"At some point -- twenty years ago? Fifteen maybe. Before pinball went out of vogue.\"",
		"\"Downstairs in the hall -- next to the main door. One of them even works. I've seen one of the Hardies bang away at it.\"",
		"\"It means someone snuck through what seems like a secret route -- behind our rape victim's room. In the recent weeks. This may prove to be significant.\"",
		"\"It means someone snuck through what seems like a *secret route* -- leading to the roof. The roof, from where you can *shoot* our victim. This is significant.\"",
		"\"It means someone snuck through what seems like a secret route -- behind our rape victim's room. In the recent weeks. This may prove to be significant.\"",
		"\"Jackpot.\" The lieutenant takes out his notebook. \"These, unlike everything else here, are *new*.\"",
		"\"I wouldn't rule out Ruby coming here yet. This isn't an argument against her. People change shoes, you know. But it's not argument *for* her either.\"",
		"\"It was a *stereo-investigation* after all. It has now converged with our main investigation. Adding a new fact to *consider*.\"",
		"\"It means someone snuck through what seems like a secret route -- leading to the roof. From where you can *shoot* our victim. This is significant.\"",
		"\"The blue door was a *mega*-investigation after all -- it has now converged with our main investigation, which I would say is *quite* large.\"",
		"\"These prints, officer -- could be the prints of our killer.\"",
		"\"Three weeks maximum -- from the dust coverage. It could easily have been *one* week too. You know, officer...\" He looks at you.",
		"\"These prints, officer, could be the prints of our killer. And if not -- at least they're a good argument for this *Ruby* doing it. To present to Titus.\"",
		"\"This isn't bad at all -- it was a *good* idea to see where that door leads. Commendable work bringing us to this place.\"",
		"\"No. These little... horizontal lines are different. They look custom made to me. Or some kind of foreign print? Hard to say. Still a *boot* though.\"",
		"He inspects the tracks closer. \"The size looks about the same, actually. They're not the same *shoe*, but they *could* be the same person.\"",
		"\"Between that,\" he points to the elevator doors in the corner, \"and that,\" he points to the barred door.",
		"\"So am I. Were you aware that he had also been shot, miss?\"",
		"\"You called us. The RCM...\"",
		"\"The voice was disguised,\" he asks, clearly wishing to distract her from the images. \"Did you?...\"",
		"\"He won't be down there long, miss. We will move the body to the morgue soon.\"",
		"\"You do *not* need to know that.\" The lieutenant taps on his notebook. \"What you need is to ask normal police questions -- like...\" He waits for you to finish the sentence.",
		"\"What did you do? When you *partied*?\"",
		"\"Funny,\" the lieutenant says softly.",
		"\"And they lynched him for it?\"",
		"\"Miss, were you sexually assaulted recently?\"",
		"\"Reporting crimes is confidential in Revachol, miss.\"",
		"\"Like you partied with the deceased?\"",
		"\"I was.\" She takes a sip. \"It was the night before I saw you in the hallway -- and reminded you you're a police officer.\"",
		"\"Are you saying that you were *asked* to tell us you were assaulted?\"",
		"\"You're being sarcastic.\"",
		"\"How was it?\"",
		"\"You mean *after* they hanged him?\"",
		"\"I'm sorry, miss, but we need a definite statement.\"",
		"\"Thank you for making the call, miss. It was the right thing to do.\"",
		"\"Should we head back downstairs, officer?\" The lieutenant looks at you. \"We may have things to discuss there.\"",
		"\"I'm not.\" He turns to the woman. \"What was your relationship with the man they hanged?\"",
		"\"How did you two meet?\" The lieutenant's voice is quiet, calm.",
		"\"Nothing.\" He nods toward the yard. \"I also saw him. We had a long inspection and that sort of thing... sticks with you. Let's move on.\"",
		"\"Yes.\"",
		"\"What else?\"",
		"\"When was this?\"",
		"\"And his role in this strike was... what?\"",
		"\"I'm sorry, but we're not quite done here yet.\" He turns to you... \"We have more questions. Better to be thorough now than have to come back to this later.\"",
		"\"Which landline?\"",
		"\"I know it's difficult, miss. We can return to it later.\"",
		"\"I'm sorry to have to ask this, but have you had a physical relationship with any of the Hardie boys?\"",
		"\"Are you saying that you were *asked* to tell us you were assaulted?\"",
		"\"We will move the body to the morgue today, miss. Don't worry.\"",
		"\"This means his race was Occidental, which fits the statements of another witness,\" the lieutenant says, pleased.",
		"\"I don't see how your problems are relevant right now, officer,\" the lieutenant says in a quick, clipped tone.",
		"...then tears out a page and hands it to you. \"We have a few questions you can help us with. A few things a field autopsy alone can't answer.\"",
		"\"The questions I have assume *some* kind of foreknowledge on our part. I suggest we go and perform it now and return once we've brought ourselves up to date.\"",
		"\"It isn't. Police work is a *cooperative* sport.\"",
		"\"Miss,\" he says, turning back to the young woman. \"Excuse my colleague -- he has recently suffered brain damage. We will now go and do our duty cleaning up the deceased.\"",
		"\"Go on.\"",
		"\"That's too *pinball* for me. I just like to get autopsies right on the first try.\" He makes another note. \"Where were we?\"",
		"\"Forty-two? Are you sure? I would have had him above fifty...\"",
		"\"It's quite expensive, miss. But we'll manage without your help for now.\"",
		"\"Thank you for clearing that up, miss.\" He turns to you. \"Whenever you're ready -- I'm interested to hear what Titus Hardie has to say now.\"",
		"\"Did he tell you he had actually *done* any of those things -- here in Martinaise, I mean?\"",
		"\"The phrase was used.\" The lieutenant checks his notes and nods.",
		"\"Did he tell you he had actually *done* any of those things -- here in Martinaise, I mean?\"",
		"\"It isn't. Police work is a *cooperative* sport.\"",
		"\"You won't have to look at that sight much longer, I promise. We will return soon.\" He turns to leave.",
		"\"All right, but quickly. She has endured that sight long enough.\" He nods toward the yard. \"It's time for us to do our duty.\"",
		"\"Okay. Sure. Here you go. What else are we missing, officer?\" he asks, trying to get the questioning back on track.",
		"\"Yes -- was he bragging?\"",
		"\"That's too *pinball* for me, I just like to get autopsies right on the first try.\" He makes another note. \"Where were we?\"",
		"\"A nickname?\"",
		"\"Another *fantastic* moment,\" the lieutenant grudgingly admits. \"What next?\"",
		"\"Excuse the delay, miss,\" he says with a nod toward the yard. \"This situation will be addressed now. We'll be back soon.\"",
		"\"Do you feel guilty about what happened to him?\"",
		"\"It's intercepted radio chatter of the deceased -- recorded via a de-encryption station. It's authentic enough.\"",
		"\"You were right, officer.\" The lieutenant nods, sportsmanlike. \"He *was* Occidental.\"",
		"The lieutenant blinks -- his expression does not change.",
		"\"I guess. He came from Lelystad -- it's short for that. And it was his *army name*, apparently. He said his real name wasn't *his*. I tried to pry it out of him, but it was no use.\"",
		"\"Did that bring you together?\"",
		"\"Right again, officer.\" The lieutenant taps his blue pen at you, as though assigning another point.",
		"\"He had a combat wound -- on his chin and mouth?\"",
		"\"No,\" he answers dryly.",
		"\"We are in the process of listening to it. But haven't -- yet.\"",
		"\"Lelystad. That's a good start...\" The lieutenant writes it down in his notebook...",
		"\"I don't see how your problems are relevant right now, officer,\" the lieutenant says in a quick, clipped, *annoyed* tone.",
		"\"Oh yes,\" the lieutenant suddenly remembers. \"His hair -- if you can remember?\"",
		"\"Lely?\" The lieutenant takes out his notebook. \"That was his name?\"",
		"\"I can see you've put *quite a few* things here -- they don't all give you a point.\"",
		"\"Alright.\" The lieutenant puts the slip back in his notes and observes the young woman for a moment.",
		"\"Looks like you were right, officer.\" The lieutenant taps on his notebook once. As though assigning some kind of *point*...",
		"\"That's too *conceptual* for me, I just like to get autopsies correct -- on the first try if possible.\" He makes another note. \"Where were we?\"",
		"\"Like -- for example -- his name?\"",
		"\"What do you think it will tell us?\"",
		"\"Yes, miss. I hope you don't mind.\" The lieutenant hands you his notes.",
		"...then starts tearing out a page, but stops mid-motion. \"It just occurred to me, colleague,\" he says, turning to you. \"We *still* haven't performed a field autopsy on the deceased.\"",
		"\"Was he bragging?\"",
		"\"You were *almost* right, officer.\" The lieutenant shakes his head, like you just missed a shot in darts. \"That means his race was Occidental, not Mondial. I'll update the form.\"",
		"\"That's too *conceptual* for me, I just like to get autopsies right -- on the first try, if possible.\" He makes another note. \"Where were we?\"",
		"\"We were slightly off then. Thank you for clearing it up.\" The lieutenant makes a correction in his notes.",
		"\"Try me.\"",
		"\"Mhm,\" he nods. \"What else did you do?\"",
		"He repeats: \"Officer, before we interview this woman -- is there something I should know?\"",
		"\"I'm going to assume she overheard you -- anything else?\"",
		"He shrugs. \"That's clearly your interrogation technique. Anything else?\"",
		"\"Is there something I should know before we talk to her?\"",
		"\"The victim? Is there something I should know before we talk to her?\"",
		"\"Okay,\" he nods. \"That's manageable.\"",
		"\"Wonderful. I'm going to assume she overheard you -- anything else?\"",
		"\"Understood.\" He's stone-faced.",
		"\"Yes.\"",
		"\"Then don't *ever* say that again.\" There's a pause.",
		"\"Anything else?\"",
		"\"So she overheard you? Or did you *party* together?\"",
		"\"Anything else?\"",
		"\"What you're saying is...\" he says in a low, calm voice. \"*You* raped her?\"",
		"\"Yes.\"",
		"\"You looked strange when he mentioned the assault victim's name.\" He looks you in the eye: \"Do you know that woman?\"",
		"\"This is unprofessional.\" He repeats: \"Not sharing information with me is *unprofessional*.\"",
		"\"It doesn't matter how it *went* officer -- what else?\"",
		"\"It's not nothing, you were coming apart at the seams.\" He looks you in the eye: \"Do you know the assault victim?\"",
		"\"Understood -- you were not in good shape on Monday.\"",
		"\"It *is*,\" he nods. \"This would have been good to know *before*.\"",
		"\"It should have. Anything else?\"",
		"\"What else?\"",
		"He nods. \"We'll be all right, officer. This is nothing.\"",
		"\"What?\" The lieutenant waves you off. \"Never mind.\"",
		"\"That's good to hear.\" The lieutenant acknowledges your strange mumbling. He does not have any narcotics visibly on him as he says it. Good.",
		"\"Yes, but not *this* early -- not to my knowledge...\" He observes the petals: \"It looks dried. Preserved.\"",
		"\"As I said -- an Insulindian Lily, or a May bell. Girls pinned them on their boys during the Revolution.\"",
		"\"A big political and military conflict. Ask around, or buy a book.\" He seems annoyed by the question.",
		"\"The revolutionaries: so the communards and the anarchists. White's their colour. But the custom started in the Suzerain's army so it held meaning for the kingsmen too.\"",
		"\"Maybe -- maybe not.\" He makes a note in his little note book. \"We'll see.\"",
		"\"This is the Insulindian Lily.\" The lieutenant corrects his glasses. \"Called 'May bells' or 'Lucille's tears' during the Revolution. Girls used to pin these on soldiers before sending them off to battle.\"",
		"\"It's about girls and boys more than *sides*. Girls sending off boys who are going to their deaths -- then also dying themselves in the ruins, from dysentery and consumption. It's a symbol of the Civil War.\"",
		"\"You think so?\" A shadow runs across his face. \"She seemed forthcoming... Unusually so. Being forthcoming about some things is a good way to obscure other things.\"",
		"\"You think so?\" A shadow runs across his face. \"Being candid is the best way to lie. The appearance of candour, with some facts thrown in, draws attention away from whatever one chooses to omit.\"",
		"\"She seemed forthcoming to me... Unusually so. Being forthcoming with some things is a good way to obscure other things. But I wouldn't call myself compromised...\"",
		"\"Anyway, we should move. I suspect our investigation will bring us back soon enough.\"",
		"\"So you said to her.... What did you *mean* by it?\"",
		"\"What do you mean by that?\"",
		"\"What else could she have done? Lie? She saw there was no way to lie and get away with it.\"",
		"\"The best liars are always forthcoming... Anyway, we should move. I suspect our investigation will bring us back here soon enough.\"",
		"\"I am not easily swayed by young women. But on the other hand... the best liars are candid. And she was candid.\"",
		"\"Nothing will make them respect the RCM. But it will disrupt the game they prepared for us. We just stripped off one layer of whatever it is. Her decision to not corroborate their story was *definitely* not part of the plan.\"",
		"\"If not you, then me. It was a smart move from her.\"",
		"\"She may be trying to control the pace of the investigation. Anyway, we should move. I suspect our inquiries will bring us back here soon enough.\"",
		"\"No. The tattoos did not say so. They said he served on Semenine. I think Co Hoi is merc talk for atrocity.\"",
		"\"Korty could be short for 'Kortenaer'. One of the other mercenaries, the one he was talking to. The third one must be relaying the signal.\"",
		"\"One of the other mercenaries I think. The one he was talking to. A friend of his?\"",
		"\"I think we've got a few more questions for Klaasje, don't you?\" He looks around. \"This seems to contradict her testimony. At least to some degree.\"",
		"\"Yes,\" he says incredulously. \"It was just *locker room talk*.\" The lieutenant looks at the tape. You are familiar with this look now -- it's his *look of suspicion*.",
		"\"Indeed, but...\" The lieutenant looks at the tape. You are familiar with this look now -- it's his *look of suspicion*.",
		"\"Who knows? Maybe the tattoos would have an answer. Or maybe Co Hoi is just merc talk for atrocity. Slaughter.\"",
		"\"The harbour.\" The lieutenant takes out his notebook. \"That's the sound of a Kvalsund crane.\"",
		"\"End of recording.\"",
		"The lieutenant presses the button marked 'Arrêter' on your porta-reel; the tape stops spinning.",
		"\"A village on the Samaran isola, in South Safre. Graad committed war crimes there -- the kind of thing he talks about.\"",
		"\"Still...\" The lieutenant looks at the tape. You are familiar with this look now -- it's his *look of suspicion*.",
		"\"It seemed authentic enough. Probably recorded off their shortwave, then *edited* to seem more incriminating. He sounded like he was on patrol around the harbour walls.\"",
		"\"Why *did* you waste our time then?\"",
		"Until the lieutenant loses patience: \"What does our *limited cooperation* with the MI have to do with this?\"",
		"\"Good.\" He turns to her, the cuffs still in his hand. \"What -- in your relationship -- made you think she's romantically interested in you?\"",
		"\"Did you hear or see the shooter in the course of this?\"",
		"The lieutenant gives you a sideways glance.",
		"\"Uhm...\" The lieutenant glances at you -- then at the door.",
		"\"Why would they do that?\"",
		"\"I will escort you to the motor carriage outside, miss.\"",
		"He puts the handcuffs away. \"These won't be necessary. I will take you to Station 57 myself -- and slow the extradition process as much as I can.\"",
		"\"It may be possible to stall it indefinitely. But you *will* be safer there for the purposes of this investigation.\" He turns to you.",
		"\"Before we do...\" He turns to her, the cuffs still in his hand. \"What exactly in your relationship made you think she's romantically interested in you?\"",
		"\"No -- not just yet.\" He turns to the woman. \"Who is *Ruby*?\"",
		"\"What happens if they do?\"",
		"\"What *exactly* did you do?\"",
		"\"That's okay.\" He makes a note. \"Were you inebriated?\"",
		"The lieutenant makes a note of it.",
		"\"It's okay. Tell us as much as you're comfortable with.\" He waits for her to continue.",
		"\"The leader? Of what?\"",
		"\"I do not.\" He turns to her, the cuffs still in his hand. \"What exactly about your relationship with this person made you think she's romantically interested in you?\"",
		"\"To produce lividity matching a hanging?\"",
		"\"And you led her on?\" The lieutenant narrows his eyes.",
		"She nods. \"A fake passport and visa. Given to me by my employer. I can't even use them. My employer probably leaked the name to hurt me.\"",
		"\"We *completely* missed the tampering. Looks like you got there in time. What was this -- twenty minutes after death?\"",
		"\"We will need to take this question to the Hardie boys.\"",
		"\"About half an hour had passed since the moment of death?\"",
		"\"You were late. The marks would be faint by that time.\" He makes a small pointing motion with his pen -- it's meant for you.",
		"\"What time did you make the call?\"",
		"The lieutenant produces a pair of handcuffs...",
		"\"Interesting theory. Did she know that door exists? Had you been out here -- with her?\"",
		"\"I can do this on my own. She's not an immediate flight risk. See you tomorrow morning, officer. Downstairs, at the Whirling-in-Rags.\"",
		"\"If you knew we would find out eventually -- why *did* you waste our time?\"",
		"\"We can't go after Looskap. Not yet. There are other, saner leads.\"",
		"\"I don't understand.\" The lieutenant sounds incredulous. He still has the cuffs in his hand. \"What exactly in your relationship made you think she's romantically interested in you?\"",
		"\"I find that hard to believe, miss.\" The handcuffs jingle in his hands...",
		"\"How could we have *missed* that...\" He shakes his head. \"And when was the tampering -- twenty minutes after death?\"",
		"\"Do drugs make you aggressive?\"",
		"\"Falsified documents?\"",
		"\"You do have the form...\" He looks at your ledger.",
		"\"Officer. Regain control of yourself.\" He turns to the woman: \"What does our *limited cooperation* with the Moralintern have to do with this?\"",
		"\"He just had a hunch. Detectives have those sometimes.\"",
		"\"There may be grounds here... At least for an extended detention.\"",
		"\"I mean romantically.\" He turns to her, the cuffs still in his hand. \"What exactly in your relationship with Ruby made you think she's romantically interested in you?\"",
		"\"Actually -- I don't.\" He turns to her, the cuffs still in his hand. \"What exactly in your relationship made you think she's romantically interested in you?\"",
		"\"We'll try to make it less stressful, miss. But these are questions we *need* to ask.\"",
		"\"What time was this? When did it happen -- it would help us if you could be as precise as possible.\"",
		"\"Women like women too, officer. Try not to fixate on this. Let's move on.\"",
		"\"I do have a form...\" He looks at his notes.",
		"The lieutenant shares her confusion. Respond with something professional, now...",
		"\"Don't,\" he says and turns to her, the cuffs still in his hand. \"What -- in your relationship -- made you think she's romantically interested in you?\"",
		"\"I am not. There is more here, miss.\"",
		"\"I need the names of the companies involved. And who hired you.\" He taps on his notebook.",
		"\"You mean to suggest -- she made it?\"",
		"\"Would you say she is the...\" He looks at you. \"Eighth Hardie boy?\"",
		"\"I agree.\" The lieutenant turns to her. \"You wouldn't give us your real name -- not when people are after you.\"",
		"\"It's a shame we never got around to doing a thorough autopsy...\" He shakes his head. \"And when was the tampering -- twenty minutes after death?\"",
		"The lieutenant nods in your direction: \"It checks out.\"",
		"\"This is just an assumption.\"",
		"\"Yes miss, but...\" The lieutenant disagrees. \"For him that number is *56*.\"",
		"\"Huh?\" The lieutenant isn't quite sure he heard you.",
		"\"You're not.\" He's squinting at you.",
		"\"Forty-two. And he was *deceased*. He had been decomposing for a week.\"",
		"\"You're not.\" He's squinting at you.",
		"\"Sure -- you're 42.\" He squints. \"Let's go?\"",
		"There's silence.",
		"\"On the bright side, you've been getting *a lot* of exercise lately.\"",
		"\"You asked.\" He shrugs.",
		"\"You're not.\" He's squinting at you.",
		"\"He was *deceased*. He had been decomposing for a week.\"",
		"\"Yes. But for him that number is higher than 45.\"",
		"\"Actually, make that 54.\" He squints. \"Alcoholism has severely impacted your appearance.\"",
		"\"Yes. But for him that number is 56.\"",
		"\"How old? Fifty-eight.\"",
		"\"Yes. But for him that number is *much* larger than 35.\"",
		"\"I didn't say 62, I said 58.\" He squints, looking at you for a second.",
		"Then a little more.",
		"\"And I *was* wrong about the age of the deceased. \"",
		"\"*Le Retour...*\" the lieutenant says. His forehead furrowed, he puts his notes down.",
		"\"And what would that miracle be?\"",
		"\"These streets?\" He looks over the railing. \"I'm not so sure, miss.\"",
		"\"Don't be so sure.\" The lieutenant looks to the sea. \"Something is coming -- *trouble*. It will be a hard spring. I don't know what it is, exactly, but...\" He shakes his head.",
		"\"I agree, detective.\" The lieutenant looks to the sea. \"Something is coming -- *trouble*. It will be a hard spring. I don't know what exactly, but...\" He shakes his head.",
		"\"Those?\" He points to them. \"A smoking assailant who favours Tioumoutiri to Astra or Drouin? Cigarette butts are everywhere. This is a common brand for old men.\"",
		"\"Truthfully -- this seems like a very poor choice to take a 1.2 kilometre rifle shot from. Visibility is awful, there's water vapour everywhere -- I think we can rule out... B double prime, was it?\"",
		"\"No, an orange pilot cap would not help.\" He turns to face the sea.",
		"\"I'm okay. You on the other hand -- look like you're about to turn into a popsicle.\"",
		"\"That seems smart, yes.\"",
		"\"No, an orange pilot cap would not help.\" He turns to face the sea.",
		"\"No. I did not. We *Seolites* don't do paranomastic humour.\"",
		"\"I don't see it, officer. I don't see a person take a shot here and hit something there...\" He looks east, over the coast. \"In the Whirling-in-Rags.\"",
		"\"It's not possible to climb that ladder and even if it were -- why? There's no platform up there to aim from.\" The lieutenant looks up, raising his collar.",
		"\"Absolute idiocy,\" he nods in acknowledgement of the idiocy on display.",
		"\"Yes, that one. No to the orange pilot cap.\" He turns to face the sea.",
		"\"Don't be silly, no one wants to be a popsicle.\"",
		"\"No.\"",
		"\"To warm his hands before pulling the trigger? Perhaps. But anyone could have made this. The coast is specked with fires this time of year.\" He looks around.",
		"\"Yes, that one. No to the orange pilot cap.\" He turns to face the sea.",
		"\"No need, officer. You wanted things to go South outside -- that's okay, we all do from time to time. They haven't, though. Yet.\"",
		"\"Maybe they are simply taking their time and will attack soon? I don't know.\"",
		"\"What is?\"",
		"\"I don't know...\" He rubs his neck. \"That's been there for years.\"",
		"\"What?\"",
		"\"Yes,\" he replies. \"The joke wasn't funny any more. I took it off.\"",
		"\"Oh yes,\" he nods. \"She left 20 minutes prior to the tribunal showing up. I asked Mr. Garte.\"",
		"\"Let's face it, officer -- and this is both of our fault...\" he says calmly -- without accusation. \"It could have gone *a little* better. Six people are dead.\"",
		"\"It's part of a detective's task chain. You can do it too.\"",
		"\"I'm sure they're worried about you.\"",
		"\"I don't know.\"",
		"The lieutenant doesn't reply -- just looks at you teetering on your feet.",
		"\"Your disco days should have been done quite a while back, officer.\"",
		"\"I don't know. I think your *incredibly dangerous* theory on Titus Hardie was wrong. More than six people saw Titus downstairs that night.\"",
		"\"Two days. In and out -- you've been up enough to take drouamine and curse. And drink water.\"",
		"\"Titus, Fat Angus, and Theo charged. Angus and Theo did not make it. They both died before they made it to intensive care. Titus survives. So do Alain and the musician, I forget his name...\"",
		"\"And Elizabeth too -- Elizabeth Beaufort was her name. The gardener.\"",
		"\"What happened? We tried to take the diplomatic route and hoped they wouldn't attack first. They did. The major gave the command.\"",
		"\"Three: Glen, Theo, Angus. The fat one, he... took a lot of bullets.\" There's a pause. \"And Theo -- he was just too old for combat.\"",
		"\"Honestly I think our investigation has not produced a single credible suspect.\" His voice is calm, matter-of-factly.",
		"He arches his brow -- the ceiling fan patiently spins overhead.",
		"\"I think we may have held it off -- for now.\" He unzips his bomber jacket. \"Barely.\"",
		"\"We won't get to him anymore. The good news is -- he's not coming here either. I did some damage.\"",
		"\"Let's face it, officer...\" he says calmly -- without accusation. \"It could have gone a little better. You could've *not* missed with the bomb. If you already threw it.\"",
		"\"The bruising in your shoulder is negligible. The armour took the brunt of the fire.\"",
		"\"Good. You'll need to be... whatever that is.\"",
		"\"I don't know. I think the theory you presented -- it's someone else, outside our circle of suspects -- was right. It'd better be. Everyone within the circle is either dead or gone.\"",
		"\"No.\" There's a short pause. \"Are you ready to limp?\"",
		"There's a little pause -- he says nothing as well.",
		"\"Hmh...\" He hums -- thinking about something else.",
		"\"It's not *ouch* time yet. You just got a *drouamine* pill an hour ago. Wait until it wears off.\"",
		"\"The whores, yes. That's good to hear.\"",
		"\"I killed her.\" The lieutenant takes a cigarette from his coat pocket and lights it. A bitter smell fills the room. \"And that's what happened.\"",
		"\"No. She bled out before Evrart's surgeon could help her. Evrart sent his personal doctor but...\" He shakes his head. \"A costly loss for the Union. She was being trained for leadership.\"",
		"There's a pause. \"I'm sure they're worried about you.\"",
		"\"Every piece of garbage in the city is not connected to the case. You don't have to catch *everything*.\"",
		"\"I shot and wounded him. While Glen took a bullet in the spine. It was meant for me -- he did not survive.\" There's a pause.",
		"\"All.\" He nods.",
		"\"As retaliation, their rifleman shot you. He hit. With his carabine -- I was looking for a clear line of sight. When I found it...\"",
		"\"No need.\"",
		"The lieutenant looks at you -- teetering on your feet.",
		"\"*Sunrise, parabellum*,\" the lieutenant says. He's in the middle of a freshly cleaned room, with the fan above his head like a halo. His face is covered in bruises.",
		"\"I don't know. I think the *dangerous* theory you presented on Klaasje was wrong. We have not found a motive, or a weapon for her.\"",
		"\"Don't be narcissistic. Half the cops in Revachol West are his *peones*. Even if you are, it is not a decisive factor in this case.\"",
		"\"It can feel that way sometimes, yes.\"",
		"\"I am glad that you do.\"",
		"\"I see the drouamine is working.\"",
		"\"What happened? You shot the major in the face. A firefight ensued.\"",
		"\"I don't think so.\" There's a short pause. \"Are you ready to limp?\"",
		"\"Maybe it's her? Maybe she kept her end... Either way, Ruby's gone. And Klaasje -- well, at least *she's* safely locked away.\"",
		"\"Why not...\" He extinguishes the cigarette on the sole of his boot.",
		"The lieutenant does not answer, instead searching his coat pockets for something.",
		"\"Four: Glen, Theo, Shanky, and Angus. The fat one, he... took a lot of bullets.\" There's a pause.",
		"\"Okay,\" he repeats.",
		"\"Ideology does not have anything to do with the murder investigation at hand, I'm sorry -- it does not.\"",
		"He nods.",
		"\"Five: Glen, Theo, Angus. The fat one, he... took a lot of bullets.\" There's a pause. \"And Titus.\"",
		"\"Reasonably bad. You were shot in the left quadriceps -- that's your thigh. It appears no major arteries were nicked. The bullet was removed and a bacterial infection treated with mercurochrome.\"",
		"\"Pretty bad, officer. You've suffered two wounds. The first is below your shoulder. The bullet passed through your shoulder blade, luckily missing your lung -- and heart.\"",
		"\"I don't know. I think the theory you presented -- it being Ruby -- did not add up. If we ever find her, we can pursue her on many offences, but not this one.\"",
		"\"We could find thousands more if we wanted. All of Revachol is full of them.\"",
		"\"I'm ready to hear what you think about solving crimes now.\"",
		"\"Are you ready to limp?\"",
		"\"Something,\" he repeats. It does not sound like he's enthused about this *some-thing*.",
		"\"Neither do I. Let's walk and hope something happens, before you bleed to death. Klaasje's room is nearby...\" He looks to the door.",
		"\"As retaliation, their rifleman tried shooting you. He missed -- or you dodged...\"",
		"\"Really? Because, to me, it seems solving crimes is *hard*.\"",
		"\"Five: Glen, Theo, Shanky, Angus. The fat one, he... took a lot of bullets.\" There's a pause. \"And Titus.\"",
		"\"Then I shot and wounded him while Glen took a bullet in the spine.\" He nods. \"It was meant for me. Glen did not survive.\" There's a pause.",
		"\"Let's face it, officer,\" he says calmly -- without accusation. \"It could have gone a little better. You could've *not* missed.\"",
		"\"Pity?\"",
		"\"Cops like it.\"",
		"\"De Paule was the last to die.\" He nods. \"Evrart had their bodies returned to Krenel for a funeral. The company is yet to retaliate.\"",
		"\"As retaliation, their rifleman tried shooting you. He hit the cuirass... I heard it go off. I was looking for a clear line of sight to him.\"",
		"He does not answer, and searches for something in his coat pocket instead.",
		"\"Four: Glen, Theo, Angus. The fat one, he... took a lot of bullets.\" There's a pause. \"And Titus.\"",
		"\"I did.\"",
		"\"We should go upstairs, rethink the ballistics *in situ*.\" A light nod, through some pain. \"I agree with this. What else?\"",
		"\"I'm afraid we may not be able to locate communism, detective -- on account of it being dead.\"",
		"\"I don't know what to think. It might not have been a *bad* idea. There is a *pin* somewhere in the machine. Something is keeping Krenel from sending in a death squad...\" He looks out the window.",
		"\"That you did.\" The lieutenant looks at you with a peculiar expression. He then continues...",
		"\"Turns out it was a bad idea not to arrest her, but...\" He shrugs. \"Maybe it was a *good deed* that will pay off in heaven.\"",
		"\"Yes.\"",
		"\"You're an officer of the RCM.\" He continues without waiting for a reply...",
		"\"Because we *deterred* them? Or Joyce did? Maybe the harbour -- in full lockdown -- is too costly a target. Or maybe...\" he breathes in the fumes, thinking.",
		"\"And...\" he smiles: \"We are still alive -- both of us.\"",
		"\"We will see.\"",
		"\"No.\"",
		"\"Neither do I. Let's walk and hope something happens before you bleed to death. Klaasje's room is nearby...\" He extinguishes the cigarette on the sole of his boot.",
		"\"Sunrise, Parabellum. Sunrise, Prepare-for-War. It's an old revolutionary saying.\"",
		"\"Oh no, officer,\" he says calmly -- without accusation. \"It's pretty bad. Six people are dead.\"",
		"\"What happened? You shot the major. Unsuccessfully. A firefight ensued.\"",
		"\"You were bleeding out by then...\" He thinks. \"You warned me -- I was able to disarm Kortenaer before he got the jump on me.\"",
		"\"Yes, she left yesterday morning. To meet the board of Wild Pines -- or that is what I've heard. There's a *pin* somewhere in the machine that keeps Krenel from sending in a death squad...\" He looks out the window.",
		"\"That was our job to find out, wasn't it? Honestly, I just don't know. Our circle of suspects is dead and gone. It's not a circle at all. It's a ruin.\"",
		"\"I killed her,\" the lieutenant repeats himself. \"And that's what happened.\"",
		"\"Mr. Garte cleaned it. It took him an entire day.\"",
		"\"Cool.\"",
		"\"Yes. We have also completely failed. But that's okay.\"",
		"\"This is the one.\"",
		"\"Yes, officer,\" he says calmly. \"Six people are dead. It's not a success.\"",
		"\"I called your station after the fight. The injury was logged in. They told me they've sent officers to join you on the site.\"",
		"\"We can't talk to Evrart, the harbour is in lockdown -- everyone in there is outside our grasp now. And Joyce has left too.\"",
		"\"It's extremely easy. There are thousands lying around from the war. All completely unusable. It's precisely how *easy* it is that makes that bullet useless.\"",
		"\"Good.\" There's a pause. \"Where do you want to limp to?\"",
		"\"Okay,\" he concedes -- clearly not meaning it.",
		"\"Let's do that.\" He looks to the ceiling. Then the door. \"Actually, I'm too tired to walk. Klaasje's room is nearby.\"",
		"\"I know you did. It's all right.\"",
		"\"She never had a chance. She should not have been there in the first place. There was no way to *convince* them.\"",
		"\"You were bleeding out, you said something, I don't know what...\" He thinks. \"And you warned me. I was able to disarm officer de Paule before she got the jump on me.\"",
		"\"But what's done is done. The violence is cordoned off, the mercenary tribunal is neutralized. The worst scenario has not materialized -- yet.\"",
		"\"Yes. He's still alive too.\"",
		"\"Not very.\" He rubs his chin. \"I have a concussion from that woman beating me with the butt of her gun... I try to not move too much.\"",
		"\"Not very.\" He rubs his chin. \"I have a concussion from the major beating me with the butt of his gun. I try to not move too much.\"",
		"\"Easy now...\" The lieutenant turns double again, before your eyes. An orange hue of pain...",
		"\"Maybe it's her? Maybe she kept her end. Either way, Ruby's gone. And Klaasje too. We really should have arrested her, you know.\"",
		"\"Yes.\" He pulls on his cigarette intently.",
		"\"I'm listening.\"",
		"\"It really is *very* hard.\"",
		"\"No need to be melodramatic.\"",
		"He does not know what to reply. Looks out of the window, then back at you.",
		"\"Let's do that.\" He extinguishes the cigarette on the sole of his boot.",
		"\"Garte confirmed she left 20 minutes prior to the tribunal showing up.\"",
		"\"Six: Glen, Theo, Shanky, Angus. The fat one, he... took a lot of bullets.\" There's a pause. \"And Titus.\"",
		"\"The gates of the harbour are boarded up. The streets are a little more empty. Apocalyptic violence is yet to erupt, I am relieved to say.\" He looks out the window.",
		"\"Let's face it, officer...\" he says calmly -- without accusation. \"It could have gone a little better. The diplomatic approach was terrible. It was my mistake. I should have attacked...\"",
		"\"Reasonably bad. You were shot in the left quadriceps -- that's your thigh. The outer side thankfully, no major arteries were nicked. The bullet was removed and a bacterial infection treated with mercurochrome.\"",
		"\"How are you?\"",
		"\"Yes. Joyce Messier. On the boat, you know? She could have helped us. It's clear the mercenaries were working for Wild Pines. At least partially...\" He looks out the window.",
		"\"Locked up? No, she would be of more *use* to us free, honestly. But it was the right thing to do.\"",
		"\"Absolutely,\" he nods. \"There's no other way to go about it. We screwed up.\"",
		"\"Every piece of garbage in the city is not connected to the case. You don't have to keep *everything*.\"",
		"\"Five: Glen, Theo, Shanky, and Angus, the fat one, he... took a lot of bullets.\" There's a pause.",
		"\"Uhuh,\" he nods. \"I see the drouamine is working.\"",
		"\"... is in a private hospital across the river. Krenel claimed him from the local butcher shop, where Titus died. Turns out he's *insured*.\"",
		"\"The second shot hit you in the thigh -- the left quadriceps.\" He points to your leg. \"No major arteries were nicked, but the bullet had to be removed. A bacterial infection was treated with mercurochrome.\"",
		"\"Things would be much worse if you didn't warn me.\" There's a pause. \"Thank you. I did not see him coming. Stupid of me...\"",
		"He nods.",
		"\"Yes.\" He says. \"God curse the footprints -- not solving the case for us. *Au diable*.\"",
		"\"What?\"",
		"\"Things would be worse if you didn't warn me.\" There's a pause. \"Thank you. I did not see her coming. Stupid of me...\"",
		"You see the lieutenant's familiar shape in the orange jacket. It turns double -- then triple -- from the pain.",
		"\"Do you? Because we can't talk to Evrart, the harbour is in lockdown -- everyone in there is outside our grasp now. And Joyce has left too.\"",
		"\"I've heard people say *I* am on La Puta Madre's take.\" He looks you in the eye. \"And I am *not*.\"",
		"A nod.",
		"\"Another look at the window perhaps -- the one he was shot through? I don't know... I can't think of anything better.\"",
		"\"That's right.\" He nods in agreement. \"Ouch, indeed.\"",
		"\"Four: Glen, Theo, Angus, the fat one, he... took a lot of bullets.\" There's a pause.",
		"\"What happened? You threw an improvised petroleum bomb at the major. A firefight ensued.\"",
		"\"You tried to throw an improvised petroleum bomb. It missed. Then you said *it's a fiasco, bratan* in a funny voice. A firefight ensued.\"",
		"\"Yes.\"",
		"\"I honestly don't know.\"",
		"\"I don't know. I think your *incredibly dangerous* theory about *you* being the killer was incorrect, however. There is not one piece of evidence to support it.\"",
		"\"Mhm.\"",
		"\"Why not?\" He looks to the ceiling, then to the door.",
		"\"I had Garte open the door to your room.\" He closes the notes. \"You were running a low bacterial fever the first night.\"",
		"\"I am sure neither of us feels solid enough to keep loitering in this room -- let's go.\"",
		"\"Not this again... you pull your weight, okay?\" He waves you off. \"Let's go.\"",
		"\"It would have been easy were it not for my concussion... We both got lucky, considering the odds we faced.\" There's a pause. \"Let's go?\"",
		"\"Back there, on the plaza? I think you very nearly had a heart attack. Alcoholism has damaged you more than bullets have...\" There's a small pause. \"We should go.\"",
		"\"... behind darkness, I get it. Let's go.\"",
		"\"Back there, on the plaza? I think you very nearly had another heart attack. Alcoholism has damaged you more than bullets have...\" There's a small pause. \"We should go.\"",
		"\"A gift...\" The lieutenant turns to the staircase suspiciously, looking for any signs of another presence in the shadows above.",
		"\"I am not drawing my gun... yet. But I don't like 'gifts'.\"",
		"\"It's hardly surprising.\"",
		"\"Or some other hoodlum. This is still fresh. It wasn't here yesterday.\"",
		"\"Could be. In Revachol West, someone somewhere is always whispering about Le Retour...\" He squints his eyes at the writing. \"It's an *aerograffito*, meant for Coalition aerostatics in the lower troposphere.\"",
		"\"Time to crack this case. Let's really, really have a close look at that window in Klaasje's room.\"",
		"\"Let's go to that island.\"",
		"The lieutenant crouches, touching the fuel oil with his finger.",
		"The lieutenant has taken a small step back. He looks at your face illuminated by the flames and nods silently. Then the fire falters...",
		"\"And blood. Some of it is even yours.\"",
		"\"Looks like it, yes. This is still fresh. It wasn't here yesterday.\"",
		"The lieutenant crouches, touching the fuel oil with his finger.",
		"\"Full circle.\" The lieutenant smiles to himself. \"Back to Feld, then. When you're ready.\"",
		"\"Lights? Fire guy?\" The lieutenant looks at you. \"We should check up on that island and you...\"",
		"\"Let's go with *yes*.\" The lieutenant raises his eyebrows and whips out his notebook.",
		"\"Lights? Fire guy?\" The lieutenant looks at you. \"We should check up on that island.\"",
		"\"A word when you're done.\" The lieutenant clears his throat. His eyes are wider than usual.",
		"\"Anything else? What does this guy look like?\"",
		"\"Nothing. What happened? Where'd you hear bad words? Was it from someone on the coast? The radio?\"",
		"\"I don't think questioning four-year-olds without their parents present is gonna crack the case,\" says the lieutenant.",
		"\"Don't worry, everyone is.\" He looks at the little scruffian, then at you. \"How about we do some police work now? We're not getting anything here.\"",
		"\"You're right there.\" He looks at the little scruffian, then at you. \"Let's see if we can find some police work, shall we? We're not getting anything here.\"",
		"\"Maybe I am?\" He grins. \"Now, how about some actual police work? We're not getting anything here.\"",
		"\"Did you mean there are *electrical* lights?\" He points to the streetlight.",
		"\"I understand.\" The lieutenant's eyes are wide in surprise, despite his calm voice. \"Thank you. Let's have a word when you're finished, detective.\"",
		"\"You're bad with kids,\" the lieutenant remarks with evident glee.",
		"\"Shut up.\" The lieutenant jabs you in the ribs with his elbow, then turns to the boy...",
		"\"Don't punch your brother.... please. Don't start crying. We still need to ask more questions.\"",
		"He whispers: \"You need to keep your *dark humour* in check in front of children, okay?\"",
		"\"It can happen -- is that why we're stopping?\"",
		"\"It is -- is that why we're stopping?\"",
		"\"Yes?\"",
		"The lieutenant nods, in silence.",
		"\"I have -- is that why we're stopping?\"",
		"\"Technically -- no. It doesn't.\"",
		"\"From enemies.\" He looks up ahead. \"Enemies of the Commune of Revachol. This seafort was a revolutionary fortification, I believe...\"",
		"\"For bringing munitions to the island, maybe? And supplies. You could also *lock* the bay, when you raise the chain.\"",
		"The lieutenant looks at the mechanism overhead. \"Ah, yes... so it seems.\"",
		"The lieutenant shrugs. \"We don't get in there.\"",
		"\"Relax. No one's hiding in there. If we can't open it, others can't either -- and thus they can't get in.\" He looks at the door with a rueful smile.",
		"\"Yeah, I understand you, I like opening doors as much as the next guy, but this one is simply beyond repair and we don't have the resources needed to open it.\"",
		"\"Probably something that is no longer there.\" The lieutenant looks at the hunching, concrete toad in front of him.",
		"\"Frankly, you're just going to have to accept the fact that you can't get in through every single door.\"",
		"\"What else is there to do? *Not* accepting isn't gonna bring the fire brigade in...\" He looks at the door with a rueful smile.",
		"\"From here to the Whirling? I can't see how...\" He looks southeast and blows on his fingers: \"The church is in the way.\"",
		"\"It's military -- a service depot of some sort.\"",
		"\"Fuel -- this should do the trick...\"",
		"\"Empty... Let's look elsewhere.\"",
		"\"Bell boys...\"",
		"\"That's just a coincidence, officer. The CoMil was founded in '32...\" He bows to inspect the barrel.",
		"\"No one remembers the ICM, the connotation is less important each year...\" He bows to inspect the barrel.",
		"\"There were all sorts of groups and *groupuscules* back then. It doesn't really matter...\" He bows to inspect the barrel.",
		"\"It does.\"",
		"\"It's impossible to say.\" He looks toward the darkened doorway. \"It was chaos after the war. The name was good for getting people to join us -- Revachol West was mostly workers and criminals...\"",
		"\"No.\" He looks at it. \"An *upside down* star.\"",
		"\"No. That's the *uninhabited archipelago*.\"",
		"\"The RCM *may* descend from the ICM.\"",
		"\"Insulindian Citizens Militia. It's the official name of the communards' army. The Black and White Army of the Revolution.\"",
		"\"You *are* in a right wing police force. Those times are long gone...\" He bows to inspect the barrel.",
		"\"One of these barrels was still leaking fuel, as you saw. The city is full of things like this. Old bullets, guns, fuel...\"",
		"\"This is better preserved than the others. You can still read the sign...\" He bows to inspect the barrel.",
		"\"After...\" He thinks. \"Forty four years? That's not nearly enough time to hide what happened here, officer.\"",
		"He nods approvingly. He even smiles.",
		"\"I don't know. I am not a philosopher.\"",
		"\"The kind that's favoured by vagrants and fuel thieves. It's been a long winter... Long and cold.\"",
		"\"Someone with basic electrical skills has restored it in order to keep the room warm. Maybe it's the *fire guy*...\"",
		"The lieutenant puts his hand on the metal barrel, checking for warmth...",
		"\"It's cold now,\" he concludes. \"But someone has been maintaining it. The wiring has been repaired.\"",
		"\"That should do it.\"",
		"The lieutenant assists you, holding the canister up to the fuel tank as you tilt. Dark brown viscous fluid pours out and the room fills with a chemical smell.",
		"\"Someone with basic electrical skills has restored it in order to keep the room warm.\"",
		"\"The kind that's favoured by vagrants and fuel thieves. It's been a long winter...\"",
		"He looks at the wall socket. \"Downstairs somewhere.\"",
		"\"... Long and cold.\"",
		"The lieutenant pauses. Something seems to be pecking at the edge of his concentration. He gives you a sideways look before adding...",
		"\"Liquid carbon, I would imagine it takes *mazut*.\" He points to the open fuel cap on the side of the dynamo.",
		"\"You know, officer...\" He looks at you with a touch of concern. \"You *can* rest here if you're feeling tired. I will keep watch. You could use some rest for what's ahead.\"",
		"\"Yes. Any time. If you need a rest *later*, it's okay by me.\"",
		"\"Maybe it's better to get back to the mainland? Rest there -- you've earned it.\"",
		"\"Someone has been squatting here.\" The lieutenant inspects the bed. \"The linen is fresh. Recently washed.\"",
		"\"The offer still stands,\" he says, looking out the pillbox window. \"Take it -- you don't look so good.\"",
		"He nods. \"That one student did have some, yes. It's still out of the ordinary.\"",
		"\"Ousia...\" he enunciates the word diligently. \"I agree -- humanitarian sciences. It stands out. Not a lot of critical theory around in Revachol West...\"",
		"\"Ousia...\" he enunciates the word diligently. \"Looks like our straggler has kept some literature around -- for a quick ideological fix.\"",
		"\"Ousia...\" he enunciates the word diligently. \"Humanitarian sciences. Stands out. Not a lot of critical theory around in Revachol West anymore...\"",
		"\"Someone's made themselves a home.\" The lieutenant inspects a softcover.",
		"\"Again, I am not a philosopher. But whoever has lived here -- they have *some* education. And a certain *set* of interests.\"",
		"\"Well, yes. That one student did.\"",
		"\"Whoever has lived here -- they have *some* education. And a certain set of interests.\"",
		"\"Maybe this is one of the doors we *don't* open?\" He looks at the door, then at its bigger brother, then at the lock…",
		"\"All right.\" The lieutenant knocks on the metal. \"I retract my statement. It was naive. Let's look around and get it open.\"",
		"\"Fuel -- generator -- console. That's our best chance.\" He points to the console at the other end of the room. \"That there could open it, now that the power's on.\"",
		"\"Another part of the island probably.\" The lieutenant looks into the keyhole. \"The lock looks like it could still be usable.\"",
		"\"I think there's a console just southeast...\"  He shuffles his feet to stay warm. \"Let's look around. Getting the blast door open seems like the best plan.\"",
		"\"Fuel -- generator -- console. That's our best chance.\" He points to the console at the other end of the room. \"That there could open it, once we've put some fuel in the generator.\"",
		"The lieutenant knocks on the metal. \"I retract my statement. It was naive. Let's look around and get it open.\"",
		"\"Extra good that I do.\"",
		"\"Electrical devices do not work without electricity.\" The lieutenant looks on as you fiddle with the dial. \"We need to power the generator upstairs first.\"",
		"\"I don't know.\"",
		"\"The console of an antique computation device.\" The lieutenant points to the wires running into the machine. \"There was a generator upstairs, with wires coming out. They terminate here.\"",
		"\"This is an air-gapped system.\" The lieutenant inspects the indicator. \"*Off-air,* I think they call it. That won't work.\"",
		"\"Don't be. I have a gun.\" He takes out his sidearm, checks the barrel, then holsters it again.",
		"\"No, I'm not, but it would not be very good military technology if programmer ladies could control it remotely. Also, it's ancient. Incompatible.\"",
		"\"So did I. Not back there, but... I've felt it since we came here.\"",
		"\"There's barely anything left. That won't work.\"",
		"\"'Urgence -- Ouvert!', 'Allumer', 'Radiodiffusé'.\" He inspects the dials. \"Sounds like this device was used to control the electronics here. Maybe it still does?\"",
		"\"I think yes. Let's see...\" He points to the emergency dial switch. \"That one. The emergency open...\"",
		"\"INSULAR...\" The lieutenant leans in to inspect the cursive writing. \"This is an *off-air* radiocomputer, I believe. Used for military communications.\"",
		"\"It's on...\" He smiles. \"Turn: Emergency -- Open!\"",
		"Nothing happens. \"We need to restore power before using this, officer. There was a generator that you missed...\" He looks upstairs. \"It didn't look like there was fuel in it.\"",
		"\"Then it's extra good that mine is not.\"",
		"\"I know. It was not easy to acquire.\"",
		"\"Possibly...\" He inspects the dials. \"'Urgence -- Ouvert!', 'Allumer', 'Radiodiffusé'. It sounds like this device was used to control the electronics here. Maybe it still does?\"",
		"\"But, officer,\" he looks you in the eye, \"then we would have to *swim* back to the mainland. Let's just look around, okay.\"",
		"\"We should look around outside. There are barrels all over, maybe one of them still has something in it...\" He looks into the dim light to his right.",
		"\"We're better off looking for a mechanical solution -- if we need one at all.\"",
		"\"My Kineema?\" He shakes his head. \"I don't want to do that. Let's just look around.\"",
		"\"After you.\" The lieutenant gestures at the opening.",
		"\"The console of an antique computation device.\" The lieutenant points to the wires running into the machine. \"The generator upstairs, with wires coming out. They terminate here.\"",
		"\"Don't worry. I have a gun.\" He takes out his sidearm, checks the barrel, then holsters it again.",
		"\"This looks like a good place to aim from...\" The lieutenant looks around. He steps closer with his hand on his gun.",
		"He does not answer, just nods. With his back hunched, he looks around once more and says...",
		"\"Yes. This guy gets around.\"",
		"\"We will make up for it. Here. I feel it.\"",
		"\"No, officer. It's not an *invisible* shooter. But...\" He lowers his voice even further. \"This island, on the other hand...\"",
		"\"Do you have line of sight to the window?\"",
		"\"Good.\" He pats you on the back, three small pats in a row. \"I think we have it, detective. The origin of the shot. This is the *sniper's nest*.\"",
		"\"Where?\" He looks behind his back.",
		"\"Or *she*.\" He almost whispers. \"We should move.\"",
		"\"B triple prime...\" The lieutenant lowers his voice, stepping closer with his hand on his gun. \"This looks like a good place to shoot from.\"",
		"\"I can see it,\" he nods. \"Through the scope of a rifle. The shooter would be prone, lying on the mattress, barrel resting on the embrasure.\"",
		"He nods. \"Nothing pointed here -- many leads pointed elsewhere.\"",
		"\"In our defence -- nothing pointed here. Many, many leads pointed elsewhere.\"",
		"\"Don't beat yourself up, officer. We did not put guns in their hands, or get them drunk.\" He looks north, over the fortification, then adds:",
		"\"I have always assumed it's someone local.\" He nods.",
		"\"No, wait.\" He points to the embrasure. \"This is important, I have a feeling... What can you see?\"",
		"\"I think we have it. The origin of the shot -- this is the *sniper's nest*.\" He pats you on the back, three small pats in a row.",
		"\"You think so?\" he whispers, pointing to the mattress. \"We would *see* them if they were here.\"",
		"\"We should move. Now.\"",
		"\"Why not? We have the weapon and ballistics. As you say it's...\" He looks north, over the fortification. \"Pretty *boo-yah*.\"",
		"\"Why? We don't go everywhere in a thousand metre radius of the crime scene. That's not procedure.\"",
		"\"I may have been wrong -- when I said it was unimportant.\" He stares into the can for a second. \"This means the same person could have visited both locations.\"",
		"\"Could be a coincidence. Or -- the same person has visited Land's End and...\" He looks around, \"...here.\"",
		"\"Anything?\"",
		"\"What? Do you have line of sight to the window?\"",
		"\"I didn't see any signs of smoking inside, though. If people live there, they keep it tidy -- this here may also be a smoking spot.\"",
		"\"A good place to hide. Cosy. Relatively safe from the rain...\" He pokes the mattress.",
		"\"What does that mean? Do you have line of sight to the window?\"",
		"\"But.\" He lowers his voice again. \"This island on the other hand...\"",
		"\"A pair of binoculars? Or a scope of a *rifle*?\" He points to the makeshift bed. \"You'd be prone, lying on the mattress, barrel resting on the embrasure...\"",
		"\"Noted.\" The lieutenant stares into the can for a second.",
		"\"That embrasure... What can you see through it?\"",
		"He nods. \"The smoker's a clean person. I didn't see any signs of smoking inside. Keeps it tidy -- prefers to come out here to smoke.\"",
		"\"It's only *moderately* effective cop work until we have the weapon. It will not be, how do you say it...\" He looks north, over the fortification. \"*Boo-yah*, until we have that...\"",
		"\"Yes. It all adds up.\" He stares into the can for a second.",
		"He looks north, over the fortification. Then at the mattress.",
		"\"Yes -- what? To get things going again...\" The lieutenant steps closer. \"Fan the flame?\"",
		"\"Storm drains?\"",
		"\"I would imagine it gets tremendously difficult -- mentally -- to live in isolation.\"",
		"\"A Samaran rifle... How did you get hold of one?\"",
		"\"Now is not the time, detective...\" The lieutenant says, gently.",
		"\"In the city you move underground?\"",
		"\"We have *come* to ask you questions, nothing more.\" The lieutenant puts his hand on his holster.",
		"\"What have you been doing during all this time?\"",
		"\"And this was... when?\" The lieutenant instinctively looks to his notebook, but does not take it out.",
		"\"No.\" The lieutenant aims his pistol square at the man's head and says:",
		"\"Worn. Personalized even. Looks like this weapon has seen a lot of use. Hasn't it, sir?\"",
		"\"The RCM can provide medical services. You need to be looked over.\"",
		"\"Told you we shouldn't play Sad FM.\"",
		"\"We keep people alive. We help them survive, whatever the ideological situation. Day in and day out.\"",
		"\"Detective.\" The lieutenant gives you a stern look. \"We have not come here to discuss ideology.\" He then turns to the old man.",
		"\"So you've been there?\"",
		"\"It doesn't matter if it was made in Shantih-Shantih. All it has to do is use jacketed ammunition. And it does.\"",
		"\"Jacketed -- military-grade ammunition. Stable in flight, good for hitting something that's very, very far away...\" He says -- mostly to the old man.",
		"\"How is your health, Mr. Dros?\"",
		"The lieutenant pulls his pistol from the holster.",
		"\"The right type and the right calibre,\" the lieutenant nods -- glancing at the gun.",
		"\"Her, who?\"",
		"The lieutenant exchanges a quick glance with you, then turns to the man...",
		"\"There were posters. Campaigns.\"",
		"\"I did.\"",
		"\"The Commune of Revachol...\" The lieutenant forgets to close his mouth. \"Do you mean the ICM? You're a holdover from the...\"",
		"\"His job was to assure the army answers to civilian control -- and follows the ideology of the commune,\" the lieutenant says softly.",
		"\"We have come to ask questions regarding a murder investigation.\"",
		"\"Do you go to Martinaise often these days?\"",
		"The lieutenant aims his pistol square at the man's forehead.",
		"\"Put it down *now*, sir.\"",
		"\"If you do not comply, we will take you in. Do you understand?\"",
		"\"No one said it has to be a Belle-Magrave...\" The lieutenant does not take his eyes off the old man. \"We were just guessing.\"",
		"\"I wonder how old it is.\"",
		"\"What does it say?\" he asks doubtfully.",
		"\"Is that part of why you've been here all this time? Because the Party didn't surrender?\"",
		"\"Propaganda bunker?\"",
		"\"The paraplegic? She could have, yes...\" He seems unsure.",
		"\"I never thought the damn *cryptozoology* would factor into this... Well, we know it's here now. We *will* find it again.\"",
		"He comes to, abruptly. \"Understood. Of course,\" he says with a nod.",
		"\"No...\" He shows you the white slip of photo paper. There's a rainbow of colour -- blue, white, yellow, and brown like a child's painting.",
		"\"It's good, it's good,\" the lieutenant whispers, holding it up. \"Don't worry. We got it.\"",
		"\"No. What's going on?\"",
		"\"Our suspect's not looking so good. We should check him over -- also...\" He points to the reeds.",
		"\"Helped them?\" He falls silent for a moment. \"I don't see what more we could have done?\"",
		"\"Our suspect is not looking so good. We need to check on him -- also...\" He points to the reeds.",
		"\"We need a photo -- or no one will believe us.\" He continues to pull the lens open...",
		"\"Okay...\" With a slow ring of metal, the lieutenant slides the lens open and raises it to eye level.",
		"There's a flicker of a smile on his lips, like he can't believe what he's saying: \"We *saw* it -- it was real.\"",
		"\"It looks like it has some kind of nest there... Maybe there's proof in there.\"",
		"\"It's just a blur,\" he says, looking at the slip of paper in his hand.",
		"\"My camera.\"",
		"\"I won't be one of those fools who didn't take a picture...\" He has stopped fiddling with the camera, but does not put it down.",
		"\"I know. We *should* have... It's my fault too.\" He looks across the water. The slip of photo paper still drying in his hand, just hanging there for a second.",
		"\"Where? Where did it go?\" The lieutenant has the camera in one hand -- and a slip of white paper in the other, developing.",
		"\"The ampoule will produce a loud hiss.\" He turns to you and whispers: \"You're right. It could scare it away. I need a better moment, when it's not looking.\"",
		"\"We *need* a photo -- no one will believe us.\" He continues to pull the lens open...",
		"\"I think we should take the picture -- and then you should *back away* from the unstudied species.\"",
		"\"No.\" You have rarely seen him with that face.",
		"\"A nest?\" The whisper is anxious. \"Don't do anything now. Later, when it's gone maybe...\"",
		"\"Okay.\" After a second the lieutenant asks: \"Is it somehow related to the case?\"",
		"\"It's gone...\" The lieutenant looks north, with his hand raised to his brow.",
		"The sweat on your arms feels cold as ice. As if you're frozen as well, in the shadow of this giant statue of chitinous marble.",
		"\"The nervous system could be spread out like that...\" He whispers behind you. \"Over the extremities, like a cuttlefish.\"",
		"\"I think you should back away from the unstudied species now...\"",
		"\"I tried,\" he explains. \"But it was moving too fast. And I didn't get the ampoule in right. And...\" He gathers himself. \"Dammit. I believe my eyes. It *was* there.\"",
		"\"The paraplegic? *Or* the other one on the coast? They could have, yes...\" He seems unsure.",
		"\"It appears the insect can walk on water. Like a water strider, you know. It's almost as fast...\" He stops, short of breath. \"Uncanny...\"",
		"Your voice echoes on the water.",
		"\"Looks like it doesn't like to stay out in the open for long.\" The lieutenant squints where you're pointing.",
		"\"You're just staring at it,\" he whispers.",
		"\"A stick insect of some sort. Pretending to be the reeds...\" He shakes his head. \"Has it been there the whole time?\"",
		"\"I don't think the pheromone will do anything.\" His whisper turns to a sceptical hiss -- but he has stopped now.",
		"\"We can't just leave it standing there. We have to do *something*, detective. It could be...\" He thinks. \"It could be connected somehow even...\"",
		"\"I'm not. We should have... it's my fault too.\" He looks across the water. The slip of photo paper still drying in his hand, hanging despondently for a second.",
		"You glance over your shoulder. The lieutenant holds a piece of milled aluminium. He begins to pull it open, extremely carefully -- it's the camera!",
		"\"Shh... okay.\" The lieutenant puts his finger to his lips and nods.",
		"\"No.\" He shakes his head. \"It's gone for now, detective.\"",
		"\"*Like* you?\" He shakes his head in disbelief. \"I'm not an entomologist, okay -- neither was the para-scientist. Who knows, maybe you're right. The only thing I'm sure of is...\"",
		"You glance over your shoulder. The lieutenant holds a piece of milled aluminium. He begins to pull it open, extremely carefully...",
		"With the sound of metal sliding against metal, the lieutenant reveals the lens. The glass glints in his hand as he begins to slide in an ampoule...",
		"\"It doesn't look like that, no.\"",
		"\"Our suspect is not looking so good. We need to check on him.\"",
		"\"In three,\" the lieutenant whispers, his voice is tense. \"If it moves, you jump back, I'll shoot. Here we go. Three, two, one...\"",
		"\"Am I?\" He shakes his head. \"I don't know. I'm not an entomologist! Neither was the para-scientist. The only thing I'm sure of is...\"",
		"\"It is,\" the lieutenant whispers behind you. You hear the familiar ring of his jacket unzipping -- slowly. Painstakingly so...",
		"\"Maybe it *is* real, the pheromone...\" The lieutenant's mouth is agape.",
		"\"Okay, but...\" He shakes his head in disbelief. \"I'm not an entomologist, okay? Neither was the para-scientist. Who knows? The only thing I'm sure of is...\"",
		"He shakes his head. In silence -- an expression on his face that you've never seen there before.",
		"\"Be careful, detective... It's moving.\"",
		"He squints. \"Looks like a nest of some sort? We should have a look.\"",
		"\"I have absolutely no idea...\" The lieutenant whispers back. You hear the familiar ring of his jacket unzipping -- slowly. Painstakingly so...",
		"\"I don't think...\" He tries to explain, patting slightly: \"I don't think it had *anything* to do with the ox-spray. It was just scared.\"",
		"\"Apparently, yes -- like a water strider, only...\" He shakes his head with amazement. \"I've never seen *anything* like that in my life.\"",
		"\"We are now just another pair of crackpots who did not take a picture of the giant cryptid.... Maybe we'll get another chance? We *know* it's here now...\"",
		"\"Someone must have known about it though. Maybe there's some secret to approaching it? I have no idea... I've never heard of a species like that.\"",
		"\"It looks like the insect had some kind of nest there, look... Maybe it has left *some* proof...\"",
		"\"Careful. It may be poisonous.\" The lieutenant watches you apprehensively.",
		"\"I got it...\" You hear the lieutenant whisper, as the creature's shape develops onto photo paper in his hand: a polychrome ghost of white streaks against the reeds and the sky. And you, as a shadow before it.",
		"\"Are you sure you're okay? You thrashed around, then you bolted up, half-covered in blood from your wound.\"",
		"\"Don't worry, detective. We've solved the case. It's wrapped and done.\" He looks north. \"Are you ready?\"",
		"He frowns. \"I did not want to wake you -- perhaps I should have? Was it a job dream?\"",
		"\"You're up quick... How was your sleep?\"",
		"\"We already solved the case, remember? You were sleeping.\"",
		"\"Okay,\" he replies simply.",
		"\"Of course. I was just thinking maybe you've torn your stitches... Are you ready to move on?\"",
		"The lieutenant nods solemnly.",
		"\"You thrashed around, then you bolted up, half-covered in blood from your wound. Are you okay?\"",
		"\"Of course,\" the lieutenant nods. \"You ready?\"",
		"\"Don't worry, detective. We'll solve the case. Are you ready?\"",
		"\"Detective, you're the one in charge.\" The lieutenant motions toward the door.",
		"\"You're not thinking of trying again, are you?\" The lieutenant stares at you as you stand there, silent and brooding.",
		"\"Are you alright?\" The lieutenant steps closer, his eyes soft and worried. \"This looked... pretty intense and painful, I must admit.\"",
		"He flashes a smile, barely visible in the dark.",
		"\"Someone must have been messing with the radio, or maybe it picked up a random frequency... You wanted the primeline, right?\"",
		"\"I have something in the back we could sell so you can pay for your room. Open the suspect transport enclosure.\"",
		"\"Mhm.\" The lieutenant frowns at you.",
		"\"No, I'm afraid not.\" He straightens his spine. \"We have a murder case on our hands, remember?\"",
		"\"That they are.\" The lieutenant looks at the spinners and sighs. \"I was going to take them into evidence, but they weren't necessary for conviction. He never asked for them back.\"",
		"\"Take what you need, officer. It's going to be a long case. I'm not *protective* of my tools. Like some men are...\"",
		"\"A motorized vehicle, officer. I'm sure you are familiar with the concept. We've had these for nearly a century.\"",
		"\"As I said, they're useless anyway. I should have remembered I have these earlier...\"",
		"The lieutenant stares at you, his jaw clenched. A vein strains on his temple.",
		"\"Excuse me?\"",
		"\"Yes, hold on...\" the lieutenant takes a look at his notes. \"Her number is 005 1944 298.\"",
		"\"You're right.\" A vainglorious smile spreads over his face as he pats his machine. \"I didn't take you for a motorcar enthusiast. Do you also like TipTop, detective?\"",
		"Right away the lieutenant reaches into the cabin and turns off the radio. He's not looking at you as he says:",
		"\"Oh.\" He looks visibly disappointed. \"I guess it's not for everyone.\"",
		"\"I don't know, is it?\" The lieutenant looks back, stone-faced. \"I was going to take them into evidence, but they weren't necessary for conviction. He never asked for them back.\"",
		"\"It's been this way for a while now.\" The lieutenant shrugs. \"My guess is, the Union is listening in on our conversations -- and jamming outward communications to protect themselves from Krenel.\"",
		"The lieutenant raises an eyebrow. The ocean wind blows, bringing in the smell of salt.",
		"He remains silent.",
		"\"Yes, there's one 100 metres south of here, I think it's called Roy's Nest or something. If I'm not mistaken it should be open late.\"",
		"\"Yes.\" He frowns. \"I've never liked that crude name. It doesn't do much to improve the RCM's reputation.\"",
		"\"But seriously, let's quit joking around, alright? We have a case to investigate.\" He turns back to the cabin.",
		"The lieutenant sighs under his breath.",
		"\"Thank you.\" His eyes glide over the plaza, making sure that no one heard the sudden blast from the radio, before he turns back to the cabin.",
		"\"Don't make your unpaid hostel bill a *moral boon*, officer. It won't stick.\"",
		"\"I don't listen to them,\" the lieutenant says sharply.",
		"\"A couple weeks ago I stopped a young man for going slower than the speed of traffic. Turns out he was some Coalition official's son -- and high.\"",
		"The spinners shine so bright they reflect on the lieutenant's glasses. He doesn't say anything either.",
		"\"Mhm,\" he nods. \"I took them *and* arrested him for driving under the influence.\"",
		"\"You would be too if you had this motor carriage,\" he snaps half-seriously.",
		"\"Yes, it's my patrol vehicle. You can use the toolbox and the radio if you'd like.\" He nods at the cabin.",
		"\"An interisolary racing series. You should definitely give it a go if you like motor carriages -- it has fantastic competition.\" He smiles again.",
		"\"Exactly.\"",
		"\"No.\"",
		"The lieutenant's breath catches in his chest.",
		"Lieutenant Kitsuragi slowly begins to tap a little rhythm with his right foot. Quite a lot of time has passed.",
		"\"I have something here we could sell. Look in the back, in the suspect transport enclosure.\"",
		"\"They're spinner hubcaps -- frivolous things you put on your wheels. When the wheels come to a stop,\" he makes a spinning motion with his hands, \"the caps keep on spinning. There's no real use for them, it's just for vanity.\"",
		"\"There you go. I'll turn them off from the remote once you're done -- we just need to stand in front of the machine now.\"",
		"\"Sylvie Malaìika on the line for you, officer.\"",
		"\"No, no. That would be silly. I just...\" He hesitates. \"I don't know why I kept them. It doesn't matter. I couldn't put them on this MC anyway. A cop with spinners -- that would be outrageous.\"",
		"The lieutenant snaps off the radio, turning it back to PRIMELINE. He stares at you silently.",
		"\"I confiscated these four a little while back. We can take them to the pawnshop down by the Martinaise Canal.\"",
		"The lieutenant nods as you take the spinners.",
		"\"Oh, is that what it was called?\" He's trying hard to act surprised.",
		"He turns the pre-heater on, waits, takes out his keys and says: \"All right. Ready. I turn, you press START -- it's next to the pre-heater.\"",
		"The lieutenant is resolutely silent. Staring at the console.",
		"\"I don't like it.\" He shrugs very slightly. \"I don't know how that channel got marked.\"",
		"\"I don't like it either, but that's the way it is. The streets seem safe enough to me. If anything, taking out the mercs made things calmer. For now...\" He flicks off the radio. Silence.",
		"\"The Coupris MotorCorp does provide most of our patrol vehicles, yes.\"",
		"\"There's no use pressing the HEAT button,\" he says and jingles his keys. \"It won't start without the ignition key.\"",
		"\"Huh?\" The sound bubbles out of him, even to his own surprise.",
		"\"Look, it helps me to stay alert on long nights, okay? It's a method. I'm not some kind of *speed-freak* or...\" He shakes his head, furiously staring at his feet.",
		"\"It only happens when someone mentions the attack -- the rest is unaffected. Our best bet is to carry on like nothing happened -- that is, if we don't want us cut off the grid completely.\"",
		"\"Yes, the Bird's Nest Roy, near the canal -- we've been there. If I'm not mistaken it should be open late.\"",
		"The lieutenant snaps off the radio, turning it back to PRIMELINE. He stares at you silently.",
		"\"This is the Coupris Kineema, my motor carriage. You can use the toolbox and the radio if you'd like.\" He nods at the cabin.",
		"\"Yes, sorry about that... the Coupris Kineema does have a rather... distinctive engine sound.\"",
		"\"Give it a minute, she might be busy at the moment... takes a bit to get to the phone.\"",
		"\"God-damn-it!\" The lieutenant moves quick as a viper as he switches off the radio and sets it on primeline. Then he turns to you:",
		"\"Really?\" the lieutenant looks at you. \"Well, I'm not indifferent on the matter either.\" He adjusts his glasses, visibly pleased to have found a fellow fan.",
		"\"All right, let's *not* take them now, then come back once we realize we have to -- have this conversation *again* and then take them.\"",
		"\"No more dangerous than stepping between three armed mercenaries and eight Union men, I hope.\" He glances over his shoulder.",
		"\"You can try calling again -- just don't mention the tribunal. And remember, they're listening in.\"",
		"\"We aren't discussing this.\" After a few bars, the lieutenant turns the radio back to PRIMELINE.",
		"\"Nothing to *get into* really, but sure, let's focus on the important things.\" He pats the motor carriage.",
		"\"We should try again during business hours.\"",
		"\"Hello, Alice, please assist our colleague from the 41st Precinct here. I'm putting him on.\"",
		"\"So. Those voices they heard...\"",
		"\"That doesn't seem likely to me.\"",
		"\"The washerwoman seems to know everything that happens here. Let's ask if she heard anything, before moving on.\"",
		"The lieutenant says nothing. An ocean breeze blows in strong. He raises his jacket collar against it.",
		"The lieutenant breathes steadily, each inhalation and exhalation controlled.",
		"\"I can't explain how they heard it,\" the lieutenant continues unabated. \"I believe they heard something. And given the poverty of this part of town, I don't know how they could have heard a radio. However...\"",
		"\"If it was... that can't be it.\" The lieutenant frowns.",
		"\"No. And my radio habits are not relevant to this serious murder investigation.\"",
		"The lieutenant shrugs.",
		"\"Speedfreaks FM.\"",
		"\"I can't explain how they heard it,\" he says, ignoring your comment. \"I believe they heard something. And given the poverty of this part of town, I don't know how they could have heard a radio. However...\"",
		"\"You must be mistaken,\" the lieutenant says in a calm, measured tone. \"Anyway.\"",
		"The lieutenant raises an eyebrow. \"Well. That is true...\"",
		"\"No.\" His answer is immediate. \"I just... don't see how this furthers our investigation into a murder. That's all.\"",
		"An ocean breeze blows in strong. He raises his jacket collar against it.",
		"\"We're going to stay focused on the *case*, officer,\" the lieutenant says, words heavy with anger.",
		"The lieutenant is grimly silent.",
		"\"Yes. Mysteries like *who killed the hanged man* are our business. Not this...\"",
		"\"I don't *know* how they heard it, but...\" He returns his gaze to you. \"I know the station they imitated. So they must have heard it somehow.\"",
		"\"No. You're not going to try to recruit the twins to the Remote Viewers Division...\"",
		"\"I believe they heard something,\" he says, glancing back at the twins. \"And given the poverty of this part of town, I don't know how they could have heard a radio.\"",
		"\"Yeah. Local station, known for its kinetic music and aggressive style.\"",
		"\"Weird as it is, this situation is not connected to the murder. This isn't our business.\"",
		"\"Mhm.\" The lieutenant checks his watch. \"Anyway.\"",
		"\"Yeah.\" The lieutenant checks his watch. \"Anyway.\"",
		"\"Let's at least rule out radios before continuing. Maybe the twins didn't know it was a radio they were hearing...\"",
		"\"After you.\" The lieutenant gestures toward the old woman.",
		"\"Besides. Maybe it was just a radio they overheard -- they might not be old enough to know the difference. How would they have heard the voices?\"",
		"He pauses. \"It's... important in our line to know about all sorts of things. I know a little bit about radio culture.\"",
		"\"Neither do I.\" He sighs.",
		"\"I don't know what to say to that, or what you want me to say. I'm sorry.\"",
		"\"We could ask where the kids were when it happened.\"",
		"\"No need to apologize. I was just going to say it'd be a good idea to ask them.\"",
		"\"Let's start from the top.\"",
		"\"Let's finish this case.\" The lieutenant shakes his head. \"I want to be done with it, now.\"",
		"\"Nope.\"",
		"\"No... We're not.\" The lieutenant's gaze travels toward the coast, toward the fishing village so far away.",
		"\"There's no doubt the twins heard Speedfreaks FM. I still don't know how, without a radio -- but they did.\"",
		"\"Not necessarily. We've learned something. No idea what. Something, at least.\"",
		"\"You humiliated me. I don't care what your political beliefs are, but you painted me with the same brush. Publicly.\"",
		"\"I don't think the voices in your head are related to this, no.\"",
		"\"If you ever dare do anything like that again -- even close to it -- I will have you sanctioned. That was abhorrent.\"",
		"The lieutenant turns his attention away from the coast, back to you.",
		"\"You don't surprise me anymore, officer.\" The lieutenant's gaze cuts through you. \"Let's finish with this case. I want to be done with it, now.\"",
		"\"There's no doubt the twins heard Speedfreaks FM,\" he says, still tempering his anger. \"I still don't know how, without a radio -- but they did.\"",
		"\"Did we ask where the kids were when they heard the voice?\" The wind picks up, blowing a stray strand of the lieutenant's hair out of place. He smooths it back.",
		"\"I don't know what it means.\" The lieutenant's gaze travels toward the coast, toward the fishing village so far away.",
		"\"And, detective...\" He turns to you. He smiles. \"Thanks for this. It's been interesting.\"",
		"\"I have been defamed over *live radio*. That has never happened to me before. And it *never* will again.\"",
		"\"No, officer. Short of undoing it, there's nothing. Let's just finish this case.\"",
		"The lieutenant gives you a long look.",
		"He sighs. \"No. I was just thinking that it'd be a good idea to ask them.\"",
		"\"That did not go well. I guess the important thing is that you followed protocol and reported your lost items.\"",
		"\"It's a single-shot Kiejl A9. An *Armistice* to be precise.\"",
		"\"Did we need anything else here?\" He looks around in the cabin.",
		"He gives you a long concerned look, then nods. \"We should get on with our tasks. Work always helps me centre myself. Now... anything else you need from my vehicle or...?\"",
		"The lieutenant's eyes go wide. \"But you said...\" He shakes his head. \"Never mind.\"",
		"\"10-4. Orders are still orders. Anything else? Over.\"",
		"\"What was that?\" the lieutenant asks in a soft voice, gently grabbing your shoulder. \"It's okay, detective.\"",
		"\"I think there's a certain beauty in this giant pair of pliers. But you're right, we were focusing on your *cloak*...\"",
		"\"I was under the assumption we could ask the leader of this Union to help us get this body down. This is why we're here, right?\" He doesn't wait for you to answer.",
		"\"Sure.\" He looks at you, worried. \"Just be careful, okay? Looks like you almost strained a muscle there.\"",
		"\"What are we doing? We're awfully close to breaking into the industrial harbour -- they're bound to have information for us. I thought that was our intention...\"",
		"His eyes trace the crane's contour as if trying to memorize its majestic shape. Then he notices your gaze.",
		"\"Well, it doesn't seem too dangerous -- two metres tops. Whenever you're ready to do it, I'll be right behind you.\"",
		"\"The service cloak issued to you by your station? Yes, yes I do.\"",
		"\"Hey, hey... what happened?\" He sounds genuinely worried.",
		"He turns back to the sad piece of fabric flapping in the wind.",
		"\"Yes... we were in the middle of something -- your cloak...\"",
		"\"Good. We can always come back when you're feeling better. It's just a cloak after all.\" He looks around.",
		"\"Hell yeah!\" The lieutenant exclaims. \"My climbing might not have been as disco as your jump, but can we still get an Ace's High?\"",
		"\"The cloak? I *do* think it's yours, yes. As to whether you should go for it...\" He looks over the ledge, at the cold pavement below.",
		"\"Or it could be that we're just *exploring*.\" He looks around, wind rustling his hair.",
		"\"You could probably make the jump. You look like you've done some track and field in your day.\"",
		"\"Yes, that's one way of putting it.\" He turns to you with a faint smile, then looks back at the crane. \"It's certainly an impressive achievement of engineering.\"",
		"\"Is it?\" He looks at you, impressed. \"Kvalsund makes lot of heavy equipment, but this is phenomenal even for them.\"",
		"\"I understand. We can always come back when you're feeling better. It's just a cloak after all.\"",
		"Then he turns back to the sad piece of fabric flapping in the wind.",
		"\"I knew you could do it!\" The lieutenant exclaims. \"My climbing down might not have been as disco as your jump, but at least we can explore the harbour now.\"",
		"\"Hey, hey... what's happening? You okay?\" He sounds genuinely worried.",
		"The wind is aggressive up here. The lieutenant looks at the enormous crane towering in the distance, over the container yard.",
		"\"Yes. It was probably you.\" He looks at you. \"It does bear the RCM insignia after all.\"",
		"\"But I digress. We were focusing on your *cloak* here.\" He looks at the sad piece of fabric flapping in the wind.",
		"\"I was under the impression we're on our way to meet the king of this *castle under siege* -- Evrart -- one of the people we're interviewing. This way we may be able to get around his henchmen.\"",
		"\"Yes. It does bear the RCM insignia. And we're the only detectives in Martinaise.\"",
		"\"Yes. It is probably yours. It does bear the RCM insignia after all. Now -- how to retrieve it?\" He judges the drop.",
		"\"It's okay, you're just having a *little* panic attack. Try to breathe as slowly as you can, alright?\" He shakes you gently by the shoulder.",
		"\"Good.\" He turns away from the file cabinet. \"This is probably not relevant to our case anyway. After all, we are not investigating an accounting mystery.\"",
		"\"The leader of the Débardeurs' Union, Evrart Claire, has someone running errands for him.\" He points to the list. \"Nothing incriminating here, though.\"",
		"\"Right.\" The lieutenant's expression stiffens. \"This is probably not relevant to our case. After all, we are not investigating an accounting mystery.\"",
		"\"Evrart Claire, probably -- the head of the Débardeurs' Union.\" He inspects the note. \"One of his aides must have left it. Nothing incriminating here.\"",
		"\"Is that what you're doing with those folders over there?\"",
		"\"It's *unfortunate* for the Union to just leave their paperwork lying around like this...\"",
		"\"My thought exactly, officer.\" He turns away from the file cabinet. \"Shall we?\"",
		"\"Mr. Claire. The man was hanged with a cargo belt. A steel reinforced cargo belt. It's safe to assume the Union had *something* to do with the murder.\"",
		"\"Besides, getting the body down would benefit all of us. It's a stain on the neighbourhood.\"",
		"\"You might have noticed there's one hanging on a tree behind the hostel-cafeteria.\"",
		"\"I find that very suspicious. May I have a look?\"",
		"\"Whether you're a family man or not is unimportant right now, officer. We are here for a different reason. In fact, we should probably move on to the murder.\"",
		"\"I'm sure it's not that bad,\" the lieutenant whispers. \"At worst he has an old RCM folder, and I very much doubt even that.\"",
		"\"Are you trying to tell me you've gotten hold of some of our documents?\" The lieutenant inspects Evrart over his spectacles.",
		"\"I'm sure it's not that bad,\" the lieutenant whispers. \"At worst he has an old RCM folder, and I very much doubt even that.\"",
		"The lieutenant covers his face and sighs audibly.",
		"\"He got the name from the Census Bureau and everything else from your actions here in Martinaise.\"",
		"\"I think the odds of that...\" He looks at you. \"Are very low.\"",
		"\"I see you have gotten hold of some of our old documents.\" The lieutenant turns to Evrart. \"They should have been destroyed some time ago.\"",
		"\"Unfortunately, I can confirm this. My partner has some decidedly outmoded views.\"",
		"\"Of course,\" the lieutenant replies dryly. \"I understand. We help you -- you help us.\"",
		"\"I assure you, we are working on locating the missing sidearm as well.\"",
		"\"The officer is exaggerating,\" says the lieutenant, leaning forward. \"Of course we care about the missing firearm, and we are *actively* looking for it as well.\"",
		"\"And what do you have to gain from a war?\"",
		"\"And the kids on the street can get speed and pyrholidon?\"",
		"\"So that's why you haven't let Joyce in?\"",
		"\"I, for one, find it refreshing. Finally someone calls *themselves* a pig.\" A smile flickers in the corner of his mouth.",
		"\"So the village is doomed,\" the lieutenant says grimly.",
		"\"More fun stuff...\" He looks at you. \"Seems like we already have fun stuff to do.\"",
		"\"Drug trafficking.\"",
		"\"How did this woman come to be in possession of the firearm?\"",
		"The lieutenant nods slowly. \"Understood.\"",
		"\"So you believe the scabs were organized by the security contractor?\"",
		"\"You mean our victim?\"",
		"\"Aren't you worried we might arrest them for this?\"",
		"\"Yes-yes... Do you think this 'weasel' is somehow connected to the murder?\"",
		"The lieutenant sighs. \"Yes -- we both understand what you meant.\"",
		"\"So these *idealists* killed our victim?\"",
		"\"And what would this entail?\"",
		"The lieutenant marks something in his notebook.",
		"\"Yes. That sounds good,\" the lieutenant says with a slow nod. \"Let's do that.\"",
		"\"What makes you think the Wild Pines negotiator can't control them?\"",
		"\"Interesting. Who's second in command?\"",
		"\"He was shot in the head *before* he was hanged.\"",
		"\"By *negotiator* you mean Joyce?\"",
		"The lieutenant shrugs.",
		"The lieutenant's eyes meet yours and he shrugs.",
		"\"You want to send someone a message that the police are working for you.\"",
		"The lieutenant watches you pocket the bank note. He looks a little puzzled.",
		"\"It depends. I don't think what we just got from Mr. Claire was very useful.\" He studies Evrart.",
		"\"Would he? I'm not so sure about it.\"",
		"\"I'm not sure I understand.\" He looks to the Union boss. \"If you're asking us to break down someone's door, it's not going to happen.\"",
		"\"Did one of his *complex* theories turn out to be true?\"",
		"\"Looks like an abandoned building...\"",
		"\"It's a *tough* station to work in. You have all of Jamrock to cover -- that district should have *three* precincts, but money is what it is.\"",
		"\"My pleasure.\"",
		"\"Kinks like satellite-officers and the additional yefreitor rank I already explained.\"",
		"\"Not strange at all -- your name is Harrier Du Bois. Like it says on your police badge.\"",
		"\"Lieutenant double-yefreitor.\"",
		"\"I'm not putting up with anything,\" the lieutenant says with a little smile. \"You put your life on the line and we came out on top. That matters.\"",
		"\"It's a wartime name. Revolutionary. The kind mothers give their sons during troubled times. Like 'Undying' or 'Boxer' or 'Ironhide'.\"",
		"\"That's just the serial number. Revachol, Jamrock, Precinct 41, with some numbers thrown in there for good measure.\"",
		"\"Yes, apparently you've had a rather successful career in the past and,\" -- he pauses to examine you -- \"this leads me to believe maybe your current *situation* is only temporary.\"",
		"\"And sometimes,\" he continues, \"they just prefer the type of police work available to their current rank -- in your case, lieutenant.\"",
		"\"More than driving your motor carriage into the sea. The upside of that is, of course, you finding your badge.\"",
		"\"Good,\" he says with a quick smile.",
		"\"Décomptage is the hierarchical system employed by the Revachol Citizens Militia. It means counting down to twos.\"",
		"\"Pleased to make your acquaintance, Harrier Du Bois.\"",
		"\"Four months ago? Seems like a new document was recently made. One is handed to you as part of a promotion, or... if you lose the old one.",
		"\"Yes. It's the designation of your Precinct. Forty-one. Like mine says Fifty-seven. The 57th is mostly Industrial Harbour. A lot of asphalt. The 41st is...\" He stops.",
		"\"A new badge usually comes with a new rank. You seem to have been... doing well then.\"",
		"\"People have been through worse and gotten back on their feet, lieutenant double-yefreitor,\" he says with a reassuring little smile.",
		"\"I... uh, don't really know how to respond to that, lieutenant double-yefreitor.\"",
		"\"The lieutenant is a rank above sergeant and below captain. It's the highest rank in the RCM that still does field work. I am a lieutenant.\"",
		"\"Harrier Du Bois...\" He looks you up and down. \"It suits you. I'm going to call you 'Harry,' since it's short for 'Harrier'.\"",
		"\"Why? It's a cool name. I like it.\" He shrugs. \"Besides, you're Harry anyway. No one's ever called *Harrier*.\"",
		"\"There are many reasons one would do this. The rank above you in your precinct's *décomptage* might be taken. Or sometimes promoted officers do not *want* to replace their superiors -- out of respect.\"",
		"\"The lowest rank is junior officer -- usually teenagers. Then there are the patrol officers. Then sergeants, lieutenants, and then a captain. That's basically it, except for a few kinks.\"",
		"\"But then again...\" A faint smile. \"It's a legendary district. And a hell of a station too. It must be an honour and a curse to work with people like Pryce, McCoy, Berdyayeva...\"",
		"\"At least *something* good came out of all this.\" The lieutenant glances at the badge in your hands.",
		"\"You are given the title of 'satellite-officer' if your partner is quickly promoted through the ranks and you rise with him. You don't seem to be a satellite...\"",
		"\"'Harrier,' that's long for 'Harry'. So you *are* Harry...\" He thinks. \"Evrart was half right. Probably not a lot of people know your full name. Whoever told him you're Harry Du Bois didn't.\"",
		"\"It does seem to be a rather *special* relationship the two of you have forged, yes, lieutenant double-yefreitor.\"",
		"\"It matters more than driving your motor carriage into the sea.\" He smiles encouragingly. \"And now we've even found your badge.\"",
		"\"No. I've been putting up with you because, despite an unconventional approach, you're doing good police work.\"",
		"\"Four months ago -- I'm guessing that's when you were promoted to the rank of lieutenant double-yefreitor.\"",
		"\"The title of yefreitor is added to your rank when you decline a promotion to a higher rank -- in your case, captain,\" the lieutenant explains. \"You have declined twice. Thus you're double-yefreitor.\"",
		"The lieutenant waits for your reply. Patiently. His foot taps only a little.",
		"\"Don't worry,\" the lieutenant catches Titus's glance. \"We're *resourceful*. We'll find a good topic for us to discuss.\"",
		"\"Really?\"",
		"\"The autopsy showed there were no ligature marks. His hands were not tied. Can you explain that?\"",
		"\"What are you doing, officer?\" He lowers his voice. \"We had enough questions to keep this going.\"",
		"\"No, no,\" the lieutenant says, calmly. \"We'll stay here and discuss what happened that night.\"",
		"\"By the 'Pines cow' you mean Joyce Messier, the representative for Wild Pines?\" The lieutenant pretends to check his notes. \"The same company you're striking against?\"",
		"\"I've done this job for long enough to know that people don't just confess to first-degree murder. *Even* if it is a group responsibility. We're going to look into this.\"",
		"\"Can you give us a few more details? Did you muffle him? We haven't heard any reports of screams.\"",
		"\"What kind of mercenary?\"",
		"By your side, the lieutenant keeps his hand away from his holster. You hear the nylon of his coat hiss as he steps closer.",
		"\"He grabbed someone?\" The lieutenant is trying to make sense of this flood of information.",
		"\"Funny,\" the lieutenant says without a smile. \"But my partner and I have a serious matter to discuss with you.\"",
		"\"So am I. Now how about you get the fuck out of my town?\"",
		"\"By the 'Pines cow', you mean the representative for Wild Pines?\" The lieutenant checks his notes. \"The shipping company you're striking against?\"",
		"\"There was a bullet in the dead man's brain,\" the lieutenant checks his notes. \"Why was it there, if you hanged him?\"",
		"\"So is hanging a man slowly, without breaking his neck,\" the lieutenant replies dryly.",
		"\"What are you talking about -- embarrassment? If someone has been sexually assaulted, we need to...\"",
		"\"We had something else. Beside the *occult vision*...\" He turns to you.",
		"\"That won't be necessary. Let's just all cool off.\" He pulls you along and steps out of the booth.",
		"\"That won't be necessary. We'll be on our way for now. Let everybody cool off a bit.\" He pulls you along.",
		"\"I think we're going to stick around, thanks. Some things don't add up here, Titus.\" The lieutenant closes his notebook.",
		"\"So let me get this straight... there *is* an eighth Hardie boy, it's a *she* and you don't like us talking about her?\"",
		"\"Good -- we're all watching each other.\" The lieutenant adjusts his spectacles. \"Officer, your question?\"",
		"\"I can confirm that.\"",
		"\"C'mon, Titus. We know you didn't hang him. He was *shot*.\" He taps on his notebook. \"I know you're tired; so am I -- why don't you just...\"",
		"\"No, he's not saying that. Forget about it.\"",
		"\"But she didn't. She knows she can't lie to us. Unlike you.\"",
		"\"I've noticed the same.\" The lieutenant says to you quickly, then turns to Titus: \"Yes. He meant Oranjese literature. Women are always reading, right?\"",
		"\"C'mon, Titus. The stakes are too high here. There will be blood on the streets -- the tribunal, remember?\" He closes his notebook. \"I know you're tired -- why don't you just...\"",
		"\"I can confirm that.\"",
		"\"I've noticed the same.\" The lieutenant says to you quickly, then turns to Titus: \"Yes. He meant a professional dancer. Women are always dancing, right?\"",
		"The lieutenant adjusts his glasses, then extends his curled fist and taps Titus' bruised knuckles.",
		"\"Yes, yes, we heard all about it and the fact still stands: you were more disturbed by the tape than her.\"",
		"\"C'mon, Titus, it's been a long day. I'm tired of running back and forth between you. I can see you're tired too -- why don't you just...\"",
		"\"Yes. In fact...\" The lieutenant looks at you, then him. \"I think she thought it was a little funny.\"",
		"\"There we go.\" He jots down a note. \"Don't come to the Wild North if you're not *white* enough.\"",
		"\"No-no,\" the lieutenant intervenes -- to re-contextualize. \"My partner is a spiritual man. He was a minister before joining the RCM. Many of us were...\"",
		"\"Yes, yes, a miniature train set...\" He turns to Titus. \"The point is, this *allegorical* Kim should've just told the truth.\"",
		"\"Officer? Look at me. I need to see if your face is drooping.\" He sounds incredibly worried.",
		"\"You won't hear it.\" The lieutenant intervenes. \"That's enough for the *circus* now, officer. Let's do *procedural questions* or even...\" He nods toward the exit. \"Why not take a little breather?\"",
		"He gives you a stern sideways glance. \"Time to move to more *serious* matters. Like what really happened between you and the man you hanged.\"",
		"\"But I didn't say anything.\"",
		"\"That is absolutely not going to happen.\"",
		"\"Thank you, I'll try,\" he says dryly. \"Please understand that Kim in this story was an allegory for *you*. You shouldn't try to hide the truth.\"",
		"To your right, you sense the air move. The lieutenant draws his firearm.",
		"\" ... \"",
		"\"No,\" he whispers. \"You almost shot that girl. I don't want to...\"",
		"\"I didn't,\" the lieutenant says quietly. \"Let's not do stories. Let's do *questions*.\"",
		"He gives you a stern sideways glance. \"Time to move to more *serious* matters. Like what really happened between you and the man you hanged.\"",
		"\"He'll put the fiddle down.\" He turns to you. \"Put it down, officer.\"",
		"He gives you a stern sideways glance. \"Time to move to more *earthly* matters. Like what really happened here -- detective?\" He snaps his fingers under your nose.",
		"\"Yes, yes, three-stringed banjo...\" He turns to Titus. \"The point is, this *allegorical* Kim should've just told the truth.\"",
		"\"The witness has no *hold* on officers of the RCM. My partner was just trying to get you to come clean -- in his *unusually emotional* way.\"",
		"The lieutenant has put down his notebook -- his hand is resting on his holster. He gives you an imperceptible nod.",
		"\"No-no...\" The lieutenant intervenes to re-contextualize. \"He's just playing his *viola da gamba*. Before becoming a detective my partner was a violinist. Many of us were...\"",
		"\"In Martinaise they just kill you because they don't *like* you...\"",
		"\"No, he's not.\" He looks at you with pleading eyes.",
		"\"They kill you,\" he jots down, \"because they think it's *funny*.\"",
		"\"Did *she* kill him?\"",
		"\"Are you okay?\"",
		"\"Yes, I understand, Alain -- that's your name, right? Alain. You'll *kill* us.\" He scratches in his notebook. \"That's what they do in the Wild North.\"",
		"\"And why would you help someone like that? By taking on a murder?\"",
		"The lieutenant inclines his head, only slightly. \"Thanks for your time, Titus. Case closed.\" He takes out his notebook and writes a few words. \"Let's go, officer.\"",
		"\"No-no...\" The lieutenant intervenes -- to re-contextualize. \"He's just playing his *viola da gamba*. Before becoming a detective my partner was a violinist. Many of us were...\"",
		"\"You hanged the corpse to cover up the real cause of death -- what was it?\"",
		"The lieutenant gives a smile only you can see.",
		"\"No, no.\" He looks around. \"There is no story.\"",
		"\"Got it.\" He takes out his notebook. \"Kill you -- because they don't like you. All because...\"",
		"\"Work for the wrong company,\" he jots down, \"and they execute you.\"",
		"\"Really. We're ready to begin our report. I've already started, actually.\" He turns back to his notebook, and writes as he speaks:",
		"\"Hers -- you mean...\"",
		"\"We'll take that into account.\" The lieutenant slides his notebook into his coat pocket. He turns to leave.",
		"\"That's enough for the *shadow* now, officer. Let's do *procedural questions* or even...\" He nods toward the exit. \"Why not take a little breather?\"",
		"\"Not the point,\" he whispers. \"I just don't want to give you my gun.\"",
		"\"No,\" he whispers. \"God no.\"",
		"\"You hanged the corpse to cover up the real cause of death -- the bullet in his head.\"",
		"\"Yes, yes, like a deck of cards...\" He turns to Titus. \"The point is, this *allegorical* Kim should've just told the truth.\"",
		"\"Huh?\" The lieutenant raises his brow.",
		"\"You're *local law enforcement* aren't you?\" The lieutenant looks Titus in the eye. \"Helping troubled civilians should fall under your jurisdiction.\"",
		"\"Police paraphernalia doesn't just wash up on the coast, people. It's not like we dump it at night. She bought it, collected it.\"",
		"\"It's been taken care of,\" the lieutenant replies laconically. \"But she hasn't been.\"",
		"\"Okay...\" The lieutenant steps in. \"We've ruled out infighting. That's how this works: by exclusion. Remember, all we need to do is rule Ruby out too. That's all this is.\"",
		"\"There's *another*, right on the roof, next to Klaasje's window. How about that? You been through that door?\"",
		"\"Where have you looked for her, more precisely?\"",
		"\"While we cannot say for certain right *now*, we *will* find out.\"",
		"The lieutenant opens his notes. \"Sunday night 11:30 to 12:15 -- she was here *all* that time?\"",
		"\"Think about it -- why go through all that effort? It was her idea, wasn't it? The hanging? You went along, but she suggested it.\"",
		"\"She knew there's evidence on her -- and she knew we'd find it. This is typical suspect behaviour. Why fleeing is always incriminatory.\"",
		"\"I think it's best we just dive in,\" he whispers back, before turning to Titus and asking: \"What makes you so sure Ruby *didn't* kill him?\"",
		"\"Twenty, maybe thirty rifles, Titus. Also broken -- but still, there were too many. And there must be other caches too.\"",
		"\"It was in *your* box. I take it Ruby has been in here?\"",
		"\"Just a thought experiment. Let's go on.\" He nods for you to continue.",
		"\"A more serious consideration -- that you wish to avoid -- is that she knew what happened, because she did it.\"",
		"\"Just making sure we're on the same page.\" The lieutenant pretends to take a note. \"It doesn't all fit. We're just sharing info -- candidly.\"",
		"\"He's *thinking*. Let the man think.\" The lieutenant defends you.",
		"\"Wishful thinking has no place in a police investigation,\" the lieutenant tells Alain, his voice mild but firm.",
		"\"Thank you.\"",
		"\"Girls like girls too, Angus,\" the lieutenant explains. \"Sometimes. This is one of those times -- she liked Klaasje.\"",
		"\"It's a thought exercise, Titus,\" he explains. \"Think. You kill him. Get up there. Shoot him. Get down...\"",
		"\"Yeah, that's real *funny*. She wasn't laughing though.\" He looks at you.",
		"\"Which is why we need to talk to her as soon as possible. There *is* grounds for a questioning here -- everyone sees that.\"",
		"\"You are... insistent.\" He nods.",
		"\"Ruby could have gone up -- shot him -- come down -- all under seven minutes.\"",
		"\"This was merely a thought exercise. He did not lose his gun. Let's move on.\"",
		"\"Ehm...\" The lieutenant puts his hand on your shoulder. \"Unless we have more business, we should...\" He looks to the door.",
		"\"Ruby then threatened her -- and told her to end her relationship with the deceased.\"",
		"\"What if those two doors are connected, Eugene? Is that your name -- Eugene?\" The lieutenant leans closer.",
		"The lieutenant looks around the room, evidently enjoying the moment's respite. But before long, he puts his hand on your shoulder. \"Unless we have more business, we should...\" He looks to the door.",
		"\"You had expressed -- on occasion -- your dislike of the mercenaries' presence in Martinaise, right?\"",
		"\"She was here all night?\" The lieutenant ignores the tattooed man. \"11:30 to 12:15 -- she was here during *all* that time?\"",
		"\"A more logical conclusion -- that you wish to avoid -- is that she knew what had happened, because she *did it*.\"",
		"\"There's *another* door in the kitchen.\" He points West. \"A locked *blue* door in the wall. I saw it this morning when I was waiting for you,\" he explains. \"Ever been through that?\"",
		"\"Or a *ghost*.\" The lieutenant adds. \"It's never a ghost either -- don't worry, we've got better than that.\" He looks at you.",
		"\"Why not? You could turn this thing into an actual police force.\" He extends his hand. \"Afraid you would actually have to follow the *law*?\"",
		"\"It opens the steel door in the kitchen. The one that leads upstairs, to the roof. This key...\" he looks at the hawthorn bush outside the window, \"was right here -- with you -- all the time.\"",
		"\"No, he's not.\" He looks at you, as if making sure -- then at Titus again. \"We're just under stress here. This case needs to be solved and fast, or bad things will happen.\"",
		"\"The elevator is *outside* the building. It's an old dumbwaiter -- used for moving pinball machines up and down from the workshop.\"",
		"\"Think. You kill him. Get up there. Shoot him. Get down...\"",
		"\"If they're connected, she could've gone to the kitchen -- gone up -- shot him on the roof -- then come down. All in five minutes. How about that?\"",
		"\"He's right, you know?\" The lieutenant notes dryly. \"Great work, but the not shaking people's hands thing -- is a little odd.\"",
		"\"Wishful thinking has no place in a police investigation,\" the lieutenant tells Eugene, his voice mild but firm.",
		"\"It's just a thought experiment. Think, Shanky, you killed him. You got up there. Shot him. Got down...\"",
		"\"No, no.\" The lieutenant looks at you with slight worry. \"That's his... concentration face.\"",
		"\"We will start there.\" The lieutenant takes a quick note. \"One more question: what does Ruby look like?\"",
		"\"That makes two of us.\" He shakes his head slowly. \"Let's not waste any more time under this boardwalk. We need to clear this all up... somehow.\"",
		"\"No harm? In drinking 98.7% alcohol with a god-knows-how-old tie in it? I wouldn't be so sure.\" The lieutenant tilts his head slightly. \"However, I'm not here to judge. Let's go.\"",
		"The lieutenant has been observing you quietly all this time.",
		"\"That makes absolutely no sense.\" He thinks for a moment. \"But I guess every family has its own traditions.\"",
		"\"A relationship between a man and a talking necktie? No, apparently I am not.\" His voice rings of insincere sadness as he turns to leave.",
		"\"And what has the necktie been telling you, if I may ask?\"",
		"\"Wonderful. Very useful.\"",
		"\"Okay. So why did you put it in the bottle?\"",
		"\"I would assume, yes. Why did you put it in the bottle?\"",
		"\"Let us not linger. We have a great big mess to figure out.\" He turns to face the road ahead.",
		"\"Of course it has.\" He doesn't even look too surprised.",
		"...but then he turns away -- his gaze fixed on the road ahead. \"Let's go,\" he concludes.",
		"\"Right. Okay. Anyway, I'm glad you told me your necktie has been speaking to you. That must not have been easy.\" For a second it looks like he's about to add something...",
		"\"I've got to ask...\" he says, a peculiar look in his eyes. \"What are you doing?\"",
		"\"Alright.\" The lieutenant's face stiffens as he turns to look at the road ahead. \"I won't ask again.\"",
		"\"Then you'd better get ready.\" He frowns, then quickly adds, \"Whatever happens, I've got your back.\"",
		"\"Yes. I hear commotion...\" He cups his ear. \"Let's go.\"",
		"\"A suspect! Ruby is a suspect we chased down on the coast. She was hiding...\"",
		"\"He wasn't hanged!\" The lieutenant shouts. \"He was shot! By someone in Martinaise. They're *helping* us find the shooter.\"",
		"\"No, wait!\" The lieutenant winces and quickly turns to the mercenary leader. \"He didn't.\"",
		"\"You heard wrong!\" The lieutenant shouts. \"She -- and these men -- have been *helping* us find the shooter.\"",
		"\"She used to work in industrial espionage and...\"",
		"\"You heard wrong!\" The lieutenant shouts. \"Your friend wasn't hanged. He was shot. We found a bullet in his head.\"",
		"\"There will be ramifications -- but there don't need to be. Let's go inside and discuss what our investigation has uncovered. We have important...\"",
		"\"He was a good commander. I can see you miss him.\"",
		"\"We researched him. We contacted the ICP and looked at his birth records. That was in there. And other things...\"",
		"\"We've heard testimony. People say he was charismatic. A nice guy to be around.\"",
		"\"Klaasje -- the woman upstairs? Where is she?\"",
		"\"We should have arrested her...\" The lieutenant whispers, his eyes still on the armed mercenaries.",
		"\"A partner who needs you to get back to helping the people of Martinaise.\"",
		"\"I can assure you, with absolute certainty: there are no sequence killings taking place in Martinaise.\"",
		"\"Yes, we've been there,\" the lieutenant nods.",
		"\"Officer.\" He leans in so that only you can hear, but his tone is forceful. \"Get a hold of yourself, please.\"",
		"The lieutenant studies you, rubbing his chin.",
		"A sigh. The lieutenant buries his nose in his notebook.",
		"\"Wonderful.\" The lieutenant marks drolly. \"He has a pin.\"",
		"The lieutenant nods politely.",
		"\"You must be joking.\" He pauses, reflecting. \"Although our pay does sometimes feel like a joke.\"",
		"He scans your face as though searching for clues. \"I did not know murder investigations are supposed to be *fun*.\"",
		"\"No.\" He looks away. \"I'm not an encyclopedia. I won't be a guide either. I'm a detective.\"",
		"Even the lieutenant seems happy with this turn of events.",
		"\"Hello again, sweetie.\" Her grey eyes shine above the rims of her glasses.",
		"The lieutenant tries to pretend he's not hearing it and is out of the conversation.",
		"\"Clearly, yes. Dwelling on it longer only makes it worse.\"",
		"The lieutenant looks on, waiting for you to wrap up your analysis.",
		"The lieutenant whistles a long, quivering note...",
		"The lieutenant watches you take the transceiver with barely disguised envy.",
		"\"Who are your customers usually?\"",
		"\"Maybe Claire really is tracking down your gun.\" The lieutenant's eyebrows rise slightly. \"Hm...\"",
		"\"No one was defrauded or *jumped*, I assure you,\" the lieutenant explains as the pawnbroker opens the register and counts the cash.",
		"\"Please...\" He throws you a long-suffering look. \"No more experimental listening while we're on this case.\"",
		"\"Of course, you need a certain level of *discernment* to really appreciate the difference in quality.\"",
		"He sighs. \"Yeah, it's not good. I do hope we manage to clean this mess up somehow -- while also keeping our focus on the murder investigation.\"",
		"\"I certainly understand the impulse, but this is our job, detective. Our whole *raison d'être*. At some point, we'll need to return to it.\"",
		"\"But now you've got what you came for, so I suppose we'll have to see this business through.\"",
		"\"Thank you.\" He takes the cash, then turns to you.",
		"\"Who's to say what's possible and what's not?\"",
		"\"Here's the 70 reál you need for your bill. Do *not* waste it.\" The rest goes in his pocket.",
		"\"Here's the 130 reál you need for your bill. Do *not* waste it.\" The rest goes in his pocket.",
		"\"Put the flashlight away, officer. Having it is a privilege, not a right.\"",
		"\"That sure narrows down our list of suspects.\"",
		"\"But here's the thing, detective. *We're* the proper channels. Doing our work, right here on the ground, is how we'll solve this case. There's no need to bring the Coalition into this.\"",
		"\"It's possible in these parts of town. We ought to find her and discourage her from taking justice into her own hands.\" He looks around, worried.",
		"\"You've surprised me more than once during the course of our investigation, but I have to say it still seems like a *remote* scenario.\" He shrugs.",
		"\"Do we really have time for this?\" the lieutenant whispers to you.",
		"\"Let me make a prediction, detective. You are not going to see the inside of a Coalition warship anytime soon.\"",
		"The lieutenant looks from you to Roy and then back to you. It's clear that he hopes this tableau might still turn out to be a bad dream -- it's not, though.",
		"\"I didn't mean to offend you.\" (Drop the subject -- you don't want drugs.)",
		"\"In that case, she'll be happy to get a visit from us. *If* we can find her...\" He looks around, worried.",
		"\"To be perfectly frank, I have my reservations about this whole antenna scheme. But who knows? We may yet be surprised.\"",
		"His forehead creases. \"Do you think it may have been... Jacob Irw who drove over your roof?\"",
		"\"Here's the 60 reál you need for your bill. Do *not* waste it.\" The rest goes in his pocket.",
		"\"Yes, we'd like to sell these hubcaps,\" the lieutenant steps in and hands him the spinners.",
		"\"Right, so let me get this right,\" the lieutenant turns to you, \"you sold your sidearm, issued by the Citizens Militia, and now a civilian is running around the streets of Martinaise with it.\"",
		"\"You're right that she could cast aspersions on the force. We have to find her.\" He looks around, worried.",
		"\"Here's the 100 reál you need for your bill. Do *not* waste it.\" The rest goes in his pocket.",
		"\"A genuine Kristallsprach. This is a connoisseur's model. Good for picking up foreign milieus.\"",
		"The lieutenant steps away, pretending to admire some of the knick-knacks on display. Looks like he doesn't want to get involved...",
		"\"I'm more interested in *why* you're so fixated on this idea in the first place.\"",
		"\"I wouldn't like to guess. Your performance so far doesn't exactly inspire confidence, but all sorts of things are possible...\"",
		"\"Here's the 30 reál you need for your bill. Do *not* waste it.\" The rest goes in his pocket.",
		"\"*You* could reach the Coalition and have your talk about *la responsabilité*... *I* could grow 10 centimetres and become a flanker for the Stormers.\"",
		"\"Not at all, detective. A Kristallsprach is a fine piece of equipment, but I'm quite satisfied with my DynaWave.\"",
		"\"So you don't know what kind of arrangement he was talking about?\" The lieutenant studies the pawnbroker suspiciously.",
		"The lieutenant shifts from one foot to another, alert.",
		"The lieutenant catches your movements and meets your eyes with a look of confusion.",
		"\"You have to admit, it's rather clever, what he's done with it.\" He pauses, studying the light.",
		"\"We're not here to investigate the theft of city property.\" He leans in so the pawnbroker doesn't hear him.",
		"\"A wise investment. I agree. The best part is that you *can't* carry it around -- I would really dislike it if you could.\"",
		"\"Franconigerian knights.\" He looks at the dusty figurines in the dim light. \"I used to be very serious about these guys.\"",
		"The lieutenant studies the tiny figurine in your hand. \"I've heard about it,\" he says with amusement, \"I've heard the Headless FALN Rider rides a headless bull.\"",
		"\"This is what the loyalists looked like, yes.\" He inspects the figurine. \"At first. Then they wised up and got camouflage.\"",
		"\"Mhm. I used to be very serious about my Franconigerian knights...\" He looks at the dusty figurines in the dim light.",
		"The lieutenant studies the figurine with amusement.",
		"\"Hey, before we talk to the owner...\"",
		"\"I'm pretty sure you can pick up some odds and ends to sell here.\" He nods toward a table of knick-knacks. \"The owner seems to have *eclectic* taste.\"",
		"\"Sure. But one's financial situation could always be even better, right?\"",
		"\"It won't help our investigation to antagonize people we could interview.\"",
		"\"Sure. Why not?\" It doesn't sound like he believes in the *vision*.",
		"\"On the contrary -- we should do our part to *support* the local economy.\"",
		"\"Perhaps, but it's no use punishing yourself more.\"",
		"\"I'm pretty sure you can pick up some odds and ends to sell here. Take a look around.\" He nods toward a table heaped with knick-knacks. \"The owner has eclectic taste.\"",
		"\"It's not my intention to make it my business, just to move this investigation forward.\"",
		"\"We can't go around punishing the people we're supposed to protect for breaking laws they don't even know exist.\"",
		"He looks at you seriously. \"An officer of the Citizens Militia can't live like that. We won't be able to complete *this investigation* if you live like that.\"",
		"\"It *would* help our investigation,\" he adds, his voice softening as he looks off to the side, \"if you weren't so hard up for cash.\"",
		"\"I wouldn't go that far but...\" He shrugs. \"Why not?\"",
		"He nods. \"Go ahead, do your part to support this grass-roots initiative.\"",
		"\"It *would* help our investigation if you weren't so hard up for cash.\"",
		"\"Not top-of-the-line glass. Hope he never has to rely on it.\"",
		"\"I don't think the 'Doorgunner Megamix' will be good party material. Something about the name...\"",
		"\"That is the unofficial RCM motto, yes.\"",
		"\"Theoretically, yes. But we don't have time right now. It's generally: murder investigation first, *then* beach party.\"",
		"\"The traffic hooliganism? I hope not. Fortunately, we're not traffic cops. Should we get back to the murder?\"",
		"\"You're right.\" He straightens his back. \"Let's get back to the murder investigation.\"",
		"\"I suppose it's not really our job to figure that out.\"",
		"\"I suppose that narrows it down somewhat. Fortunately, we're not traffic cops. Should we get back to the murder?\"",
		"He seems impressed. \"That's quite likely, from what I can tell.\"",
		"\"We're not traffic cops. Should we get back to the murder?\"",
		"\"What kind of car do you think it was?\"",
		"He raises his eyebrows. \"Oh?\"",
		"\"In conclusion -- it's a colourful theory, but I don't believe Jacob Irw did this. Should we go?\"",
		"He sighs. \"If we must.\"",
		"\"The TipTop Tournée champion?\"",
		"The lieutenant shrugs. \"We're not traffic cops. Should we get back to the murder?\"",
		"\"Yes, yes, that could very well have been it. Now let's move on. We're not traffic cops.\"",
		"\"... jumping canals at night?\" He interrupts you. \"If I was Jacob Irw I wouldn't drive in *Martinaise*. The roads are awful.\"",
		"The lieutenant patiently listens to the words coming from your mouth.",
		"The lieutenant raises his eyebrows. \"That's dirt cheap.\"",
		"\"It's the Man from Hjelmdall.\"",
		"\"Okay...\" He sounds incredulous.",
		"The lieutenant raises a brow. \"*Hjelmdall* isn't a real place.\"",
		"\"Why not?\" The lieutenant ponders the offer for a moment, then decides to go for it. He takes a slice of salami from the man and chews on it.",
		"\"We should probably go tell Lena. Take a load off her mind.\"",
		"\"So... Is there anything else you want from these gentlemen, or can we get back to it?\"",
		"\"*Meaningless* is what I think this line of questioning is. Call me a sceptic, but I don't think time travel is going to solve our murder case.\"",
		"\"Yes.\" The lieutenant turns to look at you as well. \"What else, officer?\"",
		"The lieutenant clears his throat. \"I think we're done here unless you have questions *not* relating to 'time travel' for the gentlemen?\"",
		"The lieutenant rubs his forehead and mumbles something under his breath.",
		"The lieutenant flashes you a quick side-glance.",
		"\"This again, really?\" The lieutenant looks frustrated.",
		"\"I promise, he isn't.\" He lets out a sigh. \"Just please make it quick, I'll organise my notes in the meantime.\"",
		"\"You've got to be kidding me...\" The lieutenant rubs his forehead as if hit by a sudden migraine. \"What is this, detective?\"",
		"\"No, it won't be.\" He lets out a sigh. \"And even if it were, it would be a waste of a minute. Just please make it quick, I'll organise my notes in the meantime.\"",
		"The lieutenant's eyebrow is conspicuously arched.",
		"\"I promise you, it isn't.\" He lets out a sigh. \"Just please make it quick, I'll organise my notes in the meantime.\"",
		"The lieutenant doesn't utter a word, but his face says 'I told you so.'",
		"\"Another one?\" The lieutenant lets out a sigh. \"Just make it quick please.\"",
		"The lieutenant nods, then puts away his notebook. He's ready to go.",
		"\"No really,\" he assures you, \"we're not joined by the hip. You want to talk about women with him and I want to... do pretty much anything else. Don't let me hold you back.\"",
		"\"You go ahead and have your talk,\" he replies, glancing over the railing. \"I need a few things from Frittte anyways. We'll catch up later.\"",
		"He just needs some convincing before you can talk to him mano a mano.",
		"\"Goddamnit...\" mumbles the lieutenant. \"It's becoming a thing now, huh?\"",
		"\"No, I cannot,\" he agrees. \"Just make it quick, please.\"",
		"Lieutenant Kitsuragi gives you a small nod when he sees you step outside. Looks like he's been waiting for you.",
		"\"No,\" the lieutenant shakes his head. \"You don't. You need to help me find out who killed our hanged man.\"",
		"\"Oh, people *are* noticing, Gary. They've probably *dispatched* a team already.\" The pen in the lieutenant's hand glides on the rough paper of his notebook.",
		"\"Not to the present, of course, to past-Gary. They prefer to deal with problems before they become *unmanageable*. Just something to think about.\"",
		"\"Make it quick,\" remarks the lieutenant dryly and opens his notebook. \"And the question was rhetorical, not a trick.\"",
		"\"No part of *me* is part of *this* conversation. Oh, no.\" The lieutenant keeps his eyes fixed on his notebook. \"That's a special thing you two are enjoying. With each other.\"",
		"\"I concur, detective,\" the lieutenant interjects without looking up from his notes. \"It's completely *unfeasible*.\"",
		"\"I'm not going to dignify that with an answer.\" The lieutenant's voice is cold and official as he opens his notebook. \"Make it quick, we're in the middle of a murder investigation.\"",
		"\"More important than our murder investigation?\"",
		"\"No?\" he asks, surprised. \"Because I could've sworn that's what you're doing right now.\"",
		"\"No,\" the lieutenant replies with a sigh and opens his notebook. \"It really isn't. Just please make it quick, so we can get back to our low-priority murder case.\"",
		"\"Are you *still* pursuing this?\" The lieutenant gives you a tired look.",
		"The lieutenant crosses his arms and turns to look at you.",
		"\"In that case please make it extra quick, so we can get back to it,\" says the lieutenant and opens his notebook. \"I mean it.\"",
		"\"Fine.\" He opens his notebook and starts leafing through the pages. \"Just make it quick. We need to get back to our case.\"",
		"A frustrated sigh. \"I've been through this with you. I am *not*...\" He changes his mind. \"Just please make it quick, we're in the middle of a murder investigation, remember?\"",
		"\"Huh...\" The lieutenant thoughtfully rubs his chin as he turns to move \"So there is something we agree on after all. Didn't see that coming. But let's move, I don't like being up here.\"",
		"\"Really? What happened?\"",
		"\"Couple of months, a year maybe?\" he replies, glancing at his wrist-watch. \"What happened in there?\"",
		"\"Oh, of course. Now it makes sense.\" He nods, looking down at the lorries.",
		"\"René!\" he says, snapping his fingers.",
		"\"That's probably best for everyone.\" He nods. \"Let's go then.\"",
		"\"Shocking...\" He nods, covering his mouth with the back of the hand. \"Did you learn how to turn back time?\"",
		"\"But he's not going to, because this is not a school yard and we are not children.\" He looks up at the sky...",
		"\"Let's get back to work, detective. I don't like being up here.\"",
		"\"You are really starting to remind me of him. It's not a compliment. I don't like it.\"",
		"\"Huh...\" The lieutenant thoughtfully rubs his chin as he turns to move. \"So there is something we agree on after all. Didn't see it coming. But let's move, I'm getting cold.\"",
		"\"But... why?\" He looks completely perplexed for a moment, but quickly gathers himself. \"Actually, do me a favour and please don't tell me. Let's just quickly go and that'll be it.\"",
		"\"Alright, let's go. It's getting cold.\"",
		"\"Finally. I thought I have to come looking for you. What took you so long?\"",
		"\"Right...\" He nods, covering his mouth with the back of the hand. \"Did he teach you a way to turn back time?\"",
		"\"Based on other things he *believes* I wouldn't put much weight on it.\" He turns to move. \"Let's get back to work.\"",
		"\"Based on other things he *believes* I wouldn't put much weight on it.\" He turns to move. \"Now let's get back to work.\"",
		"\"Oh, of course. I didn't realize that.\" He looks at the lorries down on the street and turns...",
		"\"Rough like Cuno?\"",
		"\"Everyone had it rough around here. It's a rough time in a rough place. I'm not trying to belittle him, but find me Revacholian who didn't have it rough. They don't exist.\"",
		"\"That's probably best for everyone.\" A smirk flashes over his face as he turns to move. \"My condolences of course, but solving this case will make you feel better. I promise.\"",
		"\"Him?\" The lieutenant's eyes meet yours. He's listening.",
		"\"I hope you don't take offence if I don't pressure you for details. We really need to get back to work.\" He smiles.",
		"\"That's probably best for everyone.\" A smirk flashes over his face as his turns to move. \"My condolences of course, but solving this case will make you feel better. about it. I promise.\"",
		"\"No, I don't. But you are reminding me of him more and more. It's not a compliment, I don't like it.\"",
		"\"Wasn't that back when you became his 'race pupil'?\"",
		"\"Right...\" He nods. \"Did he teach you to turn back time?\"",
		"\"I completely agree. Your current state seems to make you very vulnerable to suggestions. And he's got a lot of them.\" He smiles.",
		"\"I hate to repeat myself, but was that not what happened back when you became his race pupil?\" He flashes you a disarming smile.",
		"The lieutenant doesn't break eye contact. He slowly nods too, then pats you on the arm...",
		"\"Yes,\" the lieutenant agrees, \"I got that vibe from him too. Explains a lot.\" His eyes turn to the gate, then back to you.",
		"\"Good good, that's very good.\" The smile persists as he turns to leave. \"I almost feel bad that we need to focus on our investigation now. But we do. Let's go.\"",
		"\"Let's go now,\" says the lieutenant and turns to move. \"It's getting cold and it's too late to put him in a foster home.\"",
		"\"Are you fucking insane?!\" the lieutenant snaps at you. \"Don't answer that! And STOP doing it! Let's go.\"",
		"\"No, but you see, you don't,\" the lieutenant explains patiently, but his voice is very tired. \"You are not Tequila Sunset and you are not an icebreaker. Stop, please!\"",
		"\"Alright, detective,\" he reaches out and pats you on the arm. It feels strangely encouraging. \"Let's get going, we've got a killer to catch.\"",
		"\"No, but you see, you don't,\" the lieutenant explains patiently, his voice suddenly tired. \"You don't plough anything, you help me solve this case, please remember.\"",
		"\"So now you want to go blind as well?\" He shakes his head. \"How about we become Those Who Solve Murder Cases instead and get back to work?\"",
		"\"No, but you see, you don't,\" the lieutenant explains patiently, although his voice is suddenly very tired. \"You're not an icebreaker or a firewalker, or even Tequila Sunset.\"",
		"\"No, but you see, you *don't*,\" the lieutenant explains patiently, although his voice is very tired suddenly. \"You're not a firewalker, you're not an icebreaker.\"",
		"\"Oh, good.\" The lieutenant's posture relaxes. \"Thank you! And sorry I asked about it. It's none of my business. Let's just get back to work.\"",
		"\"No, you are not. What you are is an RCM lieutenant conducting a murder investigation.\"",
		"\"You don't look fine and I'm *very* worried about it.\" He crosses his arms on his chest.",
		"\"No, you are not. What you are is an officer of the Revachol Citizens Militia conducting a murder investigation.\"",
		"\"No, but you see, you don't,\" the lieutenant explains patiently, although his voice is suddenly very tired. \"You're not an icebreaker or a firewalker, or even Raphaël Ambrosius Costeau.\"",
		"\"I don't think *you* are supposed to call yourself that.\" A fleeting smile crosses his lips. \"But I appreciate the honesty. Now let's get back to work.\"",
		"\"What temptations is *He* withstanding then?\" asks the lieutenant with a puzzled look.",
		"\"Hm.\" The lieutenant seems almost impressed. \"Admitting a problem is the first step forward. Perhaps now we can finally get some work done.\"",
		"\"Including drinking?\"",
		"\"I just don't understand, officer.\" The lieutenant just stands there, looking perplexed. \"Please, help me understand.\"",
		"\"The last kingsman...\" he repeats pensively, inspecting your face. \"That's fitting, I suppose. Almost as if you *did* manage to turn back time. If only for yourself.\"",
		"\"Shall we?\" He looks ready to go.",
		"\"And what is that? A walking mask?\"",
		"\"What happened to you?\" the lieutenant asks as he leans in, eyes mapping your frozen face.",
		"\"No, but you see, you don't,\" the lieutenant explains patiently, but his voice is very tired. \"You're not an icebreaker, Harry. Please stop.\"",
		"\"It's okay,\" he says quietly. \"We're both under a lot of stress right now. Let's just try to not let it get to us and remember what we came here to do.\"",
		"\"No, but you see, you don't,\" the lieutenant explains patiently, but his voice is very tired. \"Your name is Harrier Du Bois, not 'Icebreaker'.\"",
		"\"No, but you see, you don't,\" the lieutenant explains patiently, but his voice is very tired. \"You're not Raphaël Ambrosius Costeau and you're not an icebreaker!\"",
		"\"Okay, that's all right.\" He looks visibly relieved. \"As long as you understand it is a metaphor and don't build a persona around it.\"",
		"\"You look... different. Constipated somehow?\"",
		"\"Yes, your face.\" He nods, looking worried. \"Looks like you're having a stroke. Can you even move it?\"",
		"\"You know what? I don't even want to know. Let it be one of your *internal* side-cases. I just want to get back to work.\"",
		"\"Well? Smelling much *communism* around the Union boss's office?\"",
		"The lieutenant gives you a sharp sideways look.",
		"\"I thought it was a wonderful story, ma'am.\" He closes his notes and gives her a simple smile.",
		"\"Well, the man's already been dead more than a week...\" He concludes. \"I suppose a *small* diversion won't hurt too much.\"",
		"Reflexively, the lieutenant readies his familiar notebook.",
		"\"Yes, but a junior officer could...\" He takes off his glasses and thinks. Then puts them back on without wiping.",
		"\"We should go too.\"",
		"A sigh. The lieutenant buries his nose in his notebook.",
		"He sighs. \"If you say so.\"",
		"\"Truly -- a lot of legwork. My partner *adores* these kinds of things...\" The lieutenant is still catching his breath.",
		"The lieutenant tries to pretend he's not hearing it and is out of the conversation.",
		"\"I knew it...\" you hear Kim say quietly to himself.",
		"The lieutenant stares at his shoe, caked in mud. He doesn't say anything.",
		"\"Really?\"",
		"\"Lieutenant Kitsuragi.\" He shakes her hand brusquely. \"May I ask what you needed to use the phone for, ma'am?\"",
		"\"No.\" He looks away. \"I'm not an encyclopedia. I won't be a guide either. I'm a police officer.\"",
		"\"*Establishment...*\" His suspicion is confirmed. \"I thought so.\"",
		"\"We ran into your husband on the coast, madam. He was just going to finish up some work and then come back.\"",
		"\"You know... to hell with it, let's have more cryptids.\"",
		"The lieutenant studies you, rubbing his chin.",
		"A sigh. He takes off his glasses and wipes the lenses on his jacket before replacing them.",
		"\"No.\" She says -- insisting now. \"You don't have to do that. Enough of this fool's errand, Morell will do it. Or Gary. You have work to do, I've wasted enough of everyone's time.\"",
		"\"You're welcome, ma'am.\"",
		"\"To be honest, this animal sounds like a *cryptid* -- you wouldn't happen to be searching for some kind of... Gnome of Geroma would you?\"",
		"The lieutenant pulls out his notebook and begins jotting down the woman's description.",
		"\"Fine, our victim's already been dead more than a week. One more diversion won't change anything.\"",
		"\"I can't say it's the best part of town, but I wouldn't worry *too much* about a pair of grown men travelling together.\"",
		"\"I knew it. \"The lieutenant sighs. \"We're gonna be chasing made-up insects with *cryptozoologists*.\"",
		"The lieutenant gives you a sideways glance.",
		"\"It's a pseudo-science that attempts to legitimize *research* into mythological beasts and urban legends.\" The lieutenant sounds unimpressed.",
		"\"I believe we ran into your husband on the coast, madam. He seemed to be busy setting up some trap, so we didn't talk to him much.\"",
		"\"My apologies, ma'am. I did not mean to undermine your hobby.\"",
		"\"He's fine, ma'am. He couldn't get back earlier because the water lock on the canal was broken. Now he's just finishing up some work.\"",
		"The lieutenant opens his notebook but doesn't write anything.",
		"He sighs. \"I sincerely doubt it. Still, I suppose it won't hurt to keep an eye out.\"",
		"\"Are you sure we have time to go chasing after bug-hunters just now?\" The lieutenant taps his foot impatiently.",
		"\"He's fine, ma'am. He couldn't get back earlier because the water lock on the canal was broken. He should be back soon.\"",
		"\"Thanks.\"",
		"\"Why do you think there's something on the other side necessarily?\" the lieutenant asks, but you can see a spark of curiosity in his eyes.",
		"\"In any case, there's no way we can get in right now. Let's investigate further.\"",
		"\"There must be another way to wake up whoever is in there... Maybe we can try yelling into the furnace downstairs?\"",
		"The lieutenant sighs. \"Ghosts aren't real, didn't your parents tell you that? In any case, there's no way we can get in right now. Let's investigate further.\"",
		"\"There must be another way to wake up whoever is in there... Maybe we should ask the lady in the bookstore what's going on here?\"",
		"\"Can you please try to refrain from attacking random things?\"",
		"\"My god...\" The lieutenant leans closer, his finger tracking the maddening rhizome. \"It's as if the *less money* they had, the more ambitious their project became.\"",
		"\"Exactly.\" He nods at the calendar on the chalkboard, wiping his marker-stained fingers clean against his jacket. \"This schedule -- I know *doom* when I see it. The company was running out of funding.\"",
		"\"The schedule.\" He nods at the calendar on the chalkboard, wiping his marker-stained fingers clean. \"I know *doom* when I see it -- the company was running out of funding.\"",
		"\"His shirt...\" The lieutenant squints his eyes, trying to hold back laughter.",
		"\"...\"",
		"\"Wait, suddenly you're *digging* things?\" the lieutenant whispers to you, shaking his head.",
		"\"His shirt...\"",
		"\"Different, of course.\"",
		"\"Right after you.\" He nods at the apartment door before you.",
		"\"*Very*.\"",
		"\"Who knows, detective? It's a... mystery,\" he says, turning his face away from you.",
		"\"He *smells* good...\" The lieutenant squints his eyes, trying to hold back laughter.",
		"\"Come on, detective. Let's go -- we've got a potential witness to interview -- his 'Sunday friend', remember?\" He nods at the apartment door before you.",
		"\"His shirt... No, I don't know why his shirt is always unbuttoned.\" His mouth tightens, as though trying to hold something back.",
		"\"Something so mysterious about the way he talks...\" The lieutenant squints his eyes, trying to hold back laughter.",
		"Something flutters in the corner of the lieutenant's mouth as you're saying those words.",
		"\"You liked talking to him...\" The lieutenant squints his eyes, trying to hold back laughter.",
		"\"He smells good and that's weird.\"",
		"\"It made you feel *special*...\"",
		"\"No, you're not.\"",
		"\"Miss,\" the lieutenant jumps in, \"would it help if we offered to show you our badges?\"",
		"\"Madam, I assure you we're real police officers,\" the lieutenant repeats dutifully.",
		"\"He's actually *not* wanted for murder. We just want to talk with him.\"",
		"The lieutenant shakes his head, as though to say 'let it go.'",
		"\"Thank you.\" He turns to you. \"We should go check out his apartment on the balcony, see if he's home.\"",
		"\"We saw unpaid utility bills -- aren't they going to be evicted?\"",
		"\"I thought it was obvious...\" He stops before he offends you. \"Anyway, officer. We *don't* have the witness' name.\"",
		"\"I'm not sure if you've noticed, but Martinaise isn't exactly crawling with Coalition representatives. You're going to have to look for someone else now.\"",
		"\"What, you're going to blow a lead, just like that?\" The lieutenant gives you an incredulous look.",
		"\"There must be another way into the building.\"",
		"\"Of course not,\" the lieutenant says, glaring at you. \"Frittte is an establishment that acts within the law. Is that all, detective?\"",
		"\"Good, confiscate it.\"",
		"\"I'll keep my Armistice handy, detective.\"",
		"\"This must be for the front door. Pity it doesn't have the apartment number on it. This building has hundreds of apartments.\"",
		"\"This must be for the front door. Let's see if it works.\"",
		"\"We'll just have to go in and see.\"",
		"\"I'm not your mother.\" He avoids your gaze. \"I don't care. Do what you have to do.\"",
		"\"Now, let's move on, shall we?\"",
		"\"No need to look for *supra-natural* explanations where a banal one will do. Now, let's move on, shall we?\"",
		"\"No need to look for *supra-natural* explanations where a banal one will do. Now, let's go get the flashlight, shall we?\"",
		"\"Yes, because it's *closed*...\"",
		"\"No, it's a gym,\" he disagrees. \"Though it looks like no one's been here in ages...\"",
		"\"I think you're right,\" he says. \"Though it looks like no one's been here in ages...\"",
		"\"Now, let's go get the flashlight, shall we?\"",
		"\"I doubt the electricity still works... Good thing we have a flashlight on us. Don't forget to take it out of your bag before we move on.\"",
		"\"We don't *have to* explore an abandoned gym, you know. Besides, no one's been here in ages...\"",
		"\"Yes, but no one's been here in ages.\" He draws a stripe on the dusty floor with his foot...",
		"\"You didn't *have* to ram the door down, you know...\" He looks around. \"No one's been here for ages.\"",
		"\"I doubt the electricity still works... We should find a flashlight if we want to go on. There should be one in my Kineema.\"",
		"The lieutenant nods.",
		"\"I doubt the electricity still works... Good thing we have a flashlight on us.\"",
		"\"Sounds good.\"",
		"\"Then there's the Game Master Frequency that listens in on the smaller call-in stations. I think that was supposed to coordinate the stories. Functioning as a master of ceremonies of sorts.\"",
		"\"Okay,\" he concludes. \"Let's keep moving.\"",
		"\"It looks like one of those popular pen-and-paper role-playing games -- only these people were trying to *automate* it. Make it work on *radiocomputers*.\"",
		"\"No idea... They stopped filling out the schedule on the chalkboard.\"",
		"\"Okay, well, *I* think...\" The lieutenant takes a step back, steepling his hands.",
		"\"I don't think so. I think they genuinely believed...\" The lieutenant looks around the derelict room. The pipes howl and a rat crosses the floor.",
		"\"Precisely!\" He agrees. \"It's absolutely mad -- an *automated* role-playing game.\"",
		"\"Yes, that *is* the question...\" The lieutenant takes a step back, steepling his hands.",
		"\"And by 'these people' I mean people in Soona's radio game company -- Fortress Accident.\"",
		"\"What were their ambitions? Because this here looks rather *advanced*.\"",
		"\"Indeed. It's ambitious. And *untethered* from reality, but...\" The lieutenant tilts his head, thinking.",
		"A half-smile breaks out on his face. \"It's too late for that, I'm afraid,\" he says, looking around the derelict room. The pipes howl and a rat crosses the floor.",
		"\"Indeed. Those *welkins* are a dead giveaway.\" He points to the chalkboard. \"Role-playing people love that stuff. The world looks like a modified version of the Wirrâl boardgame... with heat death thrown in.\"",
		"\"It looks like one of those popular pen-and-paper role-playing games -- only these people were trying to *automate* it. Make it work on *radiocomputers*.\"",
		"\"Yes -- especially in here.\" The lieutenant looks around the derelict room. The pipes howl and a rat crosses the floor in front of your feet.",
		"\"Yes, I got that.\" The lieutenant shifts on his feet. \"What I meant was -- what were they trying to achieve with this damn game...\"",
		"\"Through call-in stations.\" He nods at the fireplace. \"None of the players have to be physically present... Anyone in the world can participate in the game, as long as they have a two-way radio.\"",
		"\"But I don't think *anyone* has attempted to create an *interisolary* game before. We just don't have the technology.\"",
		"\"Got you.\"",
		"\"What do you think is going on here with the radiocomputer, chalkboard, and fireplace?\"",
		"\"No, that's not it. *I* think...\" The lieutenant takes a step back, steepling his hands.",
		"\"Not to my knowledge. They make automated games in Graad, Messina, Königstein... You know, places with industry.\"",
		"\"Ah yes, the *doom* of bad business practices...\" The lieutenant looks around the derelict room. The pipes howl and a rat crosses the floor.",
		"\"Does it say anything interesting?\" The lieutenant leans closer to read the crumpled note over your shoulder.",
		"\"Some local miscreant probably. There are tons of them running around in Martinaise, ready to stir up trouble. We usually dispatch our junior officers to deal with them.\"",
		"\"Looks like someone from that radiogame company upstairs. I'm a little surprised they just left their property lying here.\"",
		"\"That's implausible.\"",
		"\"That's a plausible hypothesis.\"",
		"\"Really?\" The lieutenant looks at you, the corner of his mouth curved into a smug grin. \"You don't have a single guess?\"",
		"\"Someone who owns a radiocomputer? My guess is as good as yours, officer.\"",
		"\"It belongs inside a radiocomputer, storing its memory. It's like a tape -- you listen to disco tapes, right? It's like one of your disco tapes, only for a computer.\"",
		"\"Sulisław... wasn't he one of Miss Luukanen-Kilde's coworkers?\" He tilts his head. \"I remember coming across this name when we were reading her personal log.\"",
		"The lieutenant nods.",
		"\"I don't know... I assume it's somewhere close to the ice bear fridge.\"",
		"\"Oh, I'm sure that child would *love* to get his hands on a filament memory -- even if he doesn't know what to do with it. He'd probably try to pawn it for speed, based on our encounter.\"",
		"\"I'm placing my bets on a certain red-haired miscreant we met before. He'd probably try to pawn it for speed, based on our encounter.\"",
		"\"Yes. Not bad at all.\" The lieutenant joins in. You feel your hands shake as awareness of your body returns to you.",
		"\"Let's go, officer.\" The lieutenant closes his notes. \"These people wouldn't know a good performance if it bit them in the ass.\"",
		"\"I can see that.\" The lieutenant steps away from the stage, ready for your performance.",
		"The lieutenant doesn't say anything, but gives you a quick smile, before turning away.",
		"\"Yes,\" he bows lightly. \"It was downright tragic, detective.\"",
		"The lieutenant doesn't say anything -- but he smiles sadly.",
		"\"My fuel oil is for my Kineema. Use your own fuel if you are unable to contain your artistic impulses, but please, leave my Kineema out of it.\"",
		"The lieutenant lets slip a sigh that seems to suggest this turn was utterly predictable.",
		"The lieutenant consults his notebook. \"'Remember Dobreva and Abadanaiz'.\"",
		"\"Not to interfere in your personal errand, but I wonder whether it might have something to do with that phrase Mañana mentioned overhearing.\"",
		"\"You're right. How *foolish* of me. Won't happen again, detective.\"",
		"\"Do you know something about that?\" asks the lieutenant. His question goes ignored.",
		"\"Fuel?\" He looks at the empty bucket, then back at her, struck by a sudden realization.",
		"\"*Ahem*...\" The lieutenant clears his throat.",
		"The lieutenant furrows his brow at another one of your eccentricisms.",
		"\"Yes. We should go talk to her.\" He nods in her direction. \"She's a professional negotiator, though. I have the feeling she will be very cooperative -- while telling us nothing.\"",
		"\"Probably the Wild Pines rep. We should talk to her.\" He nods in her direction. \"She's a professional negotiator, though. I have the feeling she will be very cooperative -- while telling us nothing.\"",
		"\"That wasn't paint. It was heavy fuel oil, marked red for use by government vehicles.\"",
		"The lieutenant nods.",
		"Even the lieutenant leans in closer to inspect the work.",
		"\"Perfect, she isn't interested,\" the lieutenant murmurs to himself, \"all the more reason to move on from this little side task.\"",
		"The lieutenant is desperately searching for another handkerchief.",
		"\"No, we will not shake anyone down today,\" the lieutenant clears up, his voice calm and measured.",
		"\"You should take the lead, ask her unexpected questions -- you know, do your thing. Don't be afraid to get a bit *wacky*. Throwing her off is our best bet.\"",
		"\"Let's be realistic. What are you going to do, climb up there?\"",
		"\"Oh well.\" He shrugs. \"Nothing we can do about it now.\"",
		"The lieutenant is desperately searching for a handkerchief.",
		"\"It was not a concern of mine.\" The lieutenant blinks once.",
		"The lieutenant remains perfectly still except to give you a devastating case of side-eye.",
		"\"Red-dyed heavy fuel oil intended for exclusive use in government vehicles, to be precise,\" he says, studying the contents of Cindy's bucket.",
		"For the briefest instant, the lieutenant's hand hesitates above the notebook he's scribbling in.",
		"\"Actually -- there is a shortage of people who talk to us in a normal, calm, informative manner.\"",
		"\"The streets will not flow red with anything. Who are you?\"",
		"The lieutenant, needless to say, is not impressed.",
		"\"We have a policy that means we cannot hire any SKULL members onto the force.\"",
		"\"Go where? Accosting a minor?\"",
		"\"That fuel oil was marked red for use by government vehicles only.\" He looks at the empty bucket.",
		"\"Great, the little foray into the art world continues,\" murmurs the lieutenant, looking up.",
		"\"Or a weakness for police officers, miss.\" He makes a note in his notebook. \"Thank you either way.\"",
		"\"Of course you were, detective. Apologies for interrupting.\" The lieutenant smiles to himself.",
		"The lieutenant straightens his back, waiting to see where this is going.",
		"\"What can you say about the bullet so far?\"",
		"\"But back to the investigation.\"",
		"\"Some new RCM recruits get impatient with their muzzleloaders once they've trained with military-grade weapons, but they realize it's worth it, in the end.\"",
		"\"Doesn't seem *that* likely, but we'll check out all possible leads. Next step -- finding the gun itself.\"",
		"\"A jacketed bullet. Okay... It would have been shot from a military-grade breech-loading rifle, not from a muzzleloader like those typically found on the streets of Martinaise.\"",
		"He nods. \"I have to hand it to the monarchs -- it's quite admirable that they took the advice of criminologists last century and banned the use of breechloaders in peacetime.\"",
		"\"Hmm...\" The lieutenant jots something down in his notebook. \"What are you thinking? Bullet?\"",
		"\"You mean some turn-of-the-century surplus firearm?\"",
		"\"If we find who owns it, we will have likely found who *used* it -- possibly to kill our victim.\"",
		"\"Sure, there's some arms trafficking. But the laws prohibiting the use of breechloaders we inherited from the monarchy have been effective, from what I've seen.\"",
		"\"Okay. And?\"",
		"\"Let's find out. Next step -- finding the gun itself.\"",
		"\"Even the RCM uses ordinary unjacketed conical bullets. This is... strange. Very strange. I like this, officer. Strange means unique. Unique means incriminating. We need to find the gun that shot it.\"",
		"\"In conclusion: the more we know about this bullet of yours, the better.\"",
		"\"What's your best guess?\"",
		"\"Imagine if everyone -- cops, citizens -- had access to firearms that could shoot multiple rounds without pausing to reload. After the first shot, the second, third, and so on -- come much easier.\"",
		"\"What?\" The lieutenant steps closer.",
		"\"Mysterious?\" He shrugs. \"Okay. Either way, we'll know when we find the gun.\"",
		"\"An antique. That makes sense. There can't be many breech-loading rifles floating around in Martinaise, or anywhere in Revachol, really...\"",
		"\"Well, if I was the bullet -- which I'm not -- I would say: find the weapon that shot me.\"",
		"\"Surely,\" he repeats and looks at the sea, then at you putting the trap back on the ground. \"Anyway, the air is nice and fresh here...\"",
		"He purses his lips. \"Perhaps our cryptozoologists have competition in the form of an actual entomologist? Or someone else is sabotaging them? I could present more theories, but then I would be taking this on as a case -- which I'm *not*.\"",
		"\"Empty as all of them...\" he pants. \"*One* more of these and we're done...\" His face is red from the cold sea air. He crouches to catch his breath.",
		"Neither does the lieutenant. He just raises his collar -- it's cold out, as always.",
		"\"Of course. Noted.\" He looks at you, incredulously, as you place the trap back in the reeds.",
		"\"Good. Now that's done. When do you think we will return to our impending apocalypse of a murder investigation?\"",
		"\"Okay. But after that we get back to our own assignments. We've done a thorough survey of the coast now -- just running around is no longer useful.\"",
		"\"No you weren't.\" He looks at the sea, then you -- laying the trap back down on the ground.",
		"The lieutenant's gaze follows yours and lingers on the reeds, the sand, the water beyond. Then he turns back to you expectantly.",
		"\"I'm beginning to feel... somewhat sorry for them.\"",
		"\"We did *sort of* promise to tell them, didn't we...\" He seems to regret the fact.",
		"\"I meant no offence, just...\" The lieutenant doesn't know how to finish the sentence. He looks at you, putting the trap back on the ground.",
		"\"Big surprise.\" The lieutenant grins mirthlessly. \"Anyway -- one down, three to go.\"",
		"\"No-no. I'm fine. I didn't mean to complain, it's just...\" He's short-winded. The sentence ends there.",
		"\"Another empty trap,\" the lieutenant takes a note -- more out of habit than duty.",
		"\"Of course. Noted.\" He looks at you, incredulously, as you place the trap back in the reeds.",
		"He stops you. \"Don't answer that. It was a rhetorical question.\"",
		"The lieutenant stretches his back.",
		"\"Yup. The next one has a *crab* trapped in it.\" He raises his collar -- it's windy. \"These are just crab traps, you do realize?\"",
		"The lieutenant studies the trap with you. \"Well, the bait worked on *something*. This doesn't mean it was a reed-monster, though. Unless you see one in there? I just see an empty trap...\"",
		"\"Always up for a good jog -- otherwise, would I still be *on* this case with *you*?\" He smiles and raises his collar. It's windy.",
		"\"Yes. Like a cat, or another teenage psychopath.\"",
		"\"Good, good. We should be courteous and tell the cryptozoologists that one of their traps was empty, but then we can get back to *our* assignment here.\"",
		"\"I'm just...\" he breathes out. \"Glad we haven't found some poor cat trapped in one of these.\"",
		"\"Right.\" It does not look like he thinks you're right. \"Anyway, that's for the cryptozoologists to figure out now.\" He adds, for clarity: \"*We're* not cryptozoologists -- we're cops.\"",
		"\"I'm beginning to feel better about breaking into this man's apartment.\"",
		"\"There's the missing tin soldier,\" the lieutenant looks at the mugs next to each other. \"Whoever lives here might have used the Whirling's container to dump his trash...\"",
		"\"Who knows?\" The lieutenant opens his notebook. \"I'm not expecting too much from this *clothes in the trash* lead either way. It might turn out to be some random local matter. But still -- a nice coincidence.\"",
		"The lieutenant picks up one of the mugs, then puts it back down with a look of disdain.",
		"\"And now they've drawn the ire of the Union. The plot thickens, as they say.\"",
		"\"I'm really not sure we should be in here.\"",
		"\"Goddamned pinball.\"",
		"\"Unless we've veered off into a folded M dimension, I'm expecting to step out on the roof.\"",
		"\"Unless we've veered off into a folded M dimension, I'm expecting to step out on the roof -- we could ask Klaasje about this route, see how she reacts?\"",
		"He nods. \"I'll also take a room at the Whirling. One cannot get much closer to the crime scene.\"",
		"\"Let's talk to him anyway. An officer of the RCM shouldn't be sleeping in the streets. We'll figure something out.\"",
		"\"We can pick up where we left off tomorrow morning.\"",
		"\"Good to know. I'll be wherever is necessary in the morning. Bright and early, 7:30 sharp.\"",
		"\"Let's continue tomorrow, bright and early -- 7:30 sharp. I'll be waiting downstairs.\"",
		"\"You certainly have been avoiding it.\"",
		"\"Do that. I'll be waiting for you downstairs tomorrow.\"",
		"\"I'll also take a room at the Whirling.\"",
		"\"You should take care of that, then.\"",
		"\"I thought we decided to leave it to Processing.\" The lieutenant shakes his head. \"Let's not turn this into some kind of circus.\"",
		"The lieutenant leans in to listen, notebook in hand.",
		"The lieutenant nods -- then jots it down in his notes: \"Lelystad -- Lely. I like that.\"",
		"\"Armour like this isn't mass-produced -- it would have probably been fitted. Perhaps there's a record of who signed for this particular suit of armour.\"",
		"\"It is! Thank you, Alice!\"",
		"\"Hah! Yes -- what Klaasje said. Very good. That makes sense to me.\" He takes a quick note.",
		"\"A name -- this is very good. Ellis Kortenaer...\" he says to himself.",
		"\"Even that is a small miracle -- these *organizations* usually double check their inventory.\" He leans closer and shouts: \"Thank you, Alice. Great work!\"",
		"\"We should put her in the sleeping bag so the rats don't get to her.\"",
		"\"We should read this *immediately*. Like -- right now.\"",
		"The lieutenant nods.",
		"\"See anything?\" The lieutenant peeks in over your shoulder.",
		"\"I see the processing guys have been faster than usual. It's good we stopped by to check regardless.\" He nods at the lack of Ruby in the tent, then looks around. \"Now -- island time.\"",
		"He squints into the darkness, \"that tent there.\"",
		"\"Ma'am, put the gun down. That's not the solution to your problems. You are...\"",
		"\"We're cops. Everything is our fault, if we let it be...\" He looks around.",
		"\"That's illegal. I'm guessing it's patented... But we're beyond that, aren't we?\"",
		"\"Officer, are you okay?\"",
		"\"Now we have to come up with a really good excuse... for why we walked right into a trap like that. This isn't going to look good in the report.\" He looks around, then points further into the cavern.",
		"\"Really? That's... your takeaway? I'm *certain* she didn't do it.\" He looks around, then points to the back of the cavern. \"Her tent. We should check it out.\"",
		"\"A third... Oh, this is bad.\"",
		"\"It's okay... We just want to... hnghhhhh...\" He struggles to finish the sentence.",
		"\"Okay... you said it. You needed to say it. Now it's been *said*,\" he says in a slow, measured voice. \"We need to clean up.\"",
		"\"How do you know this?\"",
		"\"Damn... this...\" The lieutenant clutches his head, grimacing.",
		"\"Our job. It went really bad. And now we need to clean it up.\"",
		"\"Her tent. We should check it out.\" He points to the back of the cavern.",
		"\"Really? That's... your takeaway? I'm *certain* she didn't do it.\" He looks around, then points to the back of the cavern. \"Her tent. We should check it out.\"",
		"\"All things considered...\" The lieutenant is still reeling from the pain. \"...that could've gone worse.\"",
		"\"No, I don't think she did it... She's someone else's case now.\"",
		"\"Mmm...\" The lieutenant clutches his head as his eyes roll back into his skull.",
		"\"I would have done the same...\" He has to catch his breath. \"Had I not been incapacitated...\"",
		"He squints into the darkness, \"that tent there.\"",
		"\"Fuck.\" The lieutenant stands, motionless, watching the blood pool in the sand.",
		"\"Lieutenant-yefreitor Du Bois,\" he intones. \"Control your emotions. We did our *job*. This won't be the worst thing that happens on this case... believe me. You can't let this break you.\"",
		"\"Officer... what are you doing, you...\"",
		"\"Her tent! Maybe there's something in there.\"",
		"\"Hmgh... she's right. No one mentioned *hearing*... shots. I... the shot didn't come from the roof.\"",
		"\"*Saw my equations*?\" She snorts. \"You've been sniffing through my lorry, right? I expected as much. I *am* a bit surprised you knew what you were looking at...\"",
		"\"Police radio? You've been... following the case?\"",
		"\"I have a feeling... we didn't.\" He looks around, then points to the back of the cavern. \"Her tent. We should check it out.\"",
		"\"So, what we are experiencing is... a concentration of radio waves...\" He gestures toward something with great effort.",
		"The lieutenant hunches, recovering. \"All good, officer. Be careful.\"",
		"\"Good call...\" The lieutenant is still unsteady on his feet.",
		"\"I have a feeling... we didn't.\" He looks around, then points to the back of the cavern. \"Her tent. We should check it out.\"",
		"\"Her tent! Maybe there's something in there.\"",
		"\"We clean up.\" He looks around. \"It may take days for processing to pick up her body. We need to move it somewhere...\"",
		"\"But... even if this is true... \" The lieutenant forces himself to finish the sentence: \"Weren't you worried this 'lynching' might lead to...\"",
		"\"*Detective*,\" he intones, \"control your emotions. We did our *job*. This won't be the worst thing that happens to us on this case, believe me... You can't let this break you.\"",
		"\"Her tent. We should check it out.\" He points to the back of the cavern.",
		"\"...you made it look... like he'd been hanged...\"",
		"\"Damn... this...\" The lieutenant clutches his head, grimacing.",
		"\"Titus and his boys, ma'am. They told us you were on the coast.\"",
		"Through the sudden sharp pain in your head, you hear the lieutenant mumble something to himself.",
		"\"Yeah, I'm sure...\" He has to catch his breath. \"I would have done the same had I not been incapacitated...\"",
		"\"Right behind you, officer.\" Eyes closed, the lieutenant is doubled over. He's still alive and breathing.",
		"\"Well... we're not responsible for what we can't predict, are we? I don't think the *entire* city will be razed to the ground.\" He smiles in the dark.",
		"He lowers his voice. \"Once we detain a credible suspect, who knows what the Union and the Wild Pines will do? We'll set in motion events we have no control over.\"",
		"\"Hmm...\" He looks ahead, beyond the arch. \"Either way, we ought to be careful. There were footprints back there. And I'm pretty sure they were fresh.\"",
		"\"I don't know, little things?\" He pauses. \"But you're right. We've gotten everything we can from the Union.\"",
		"\"You mean Lena? I don't see how cryptozoology and the murder investigation are connected. But... the situation in the city will get tense for everyone.\"",
		"\"No. What do you mean?\"",
		"\"Possibly. If she's in here, we need to plan our next step carefully.\"",
		"\"If you want to do that, then yes. We'd be advised to finish every lead. I don't think we'll have the chance to after...\" He looks down the dark tunnel. He does not finish the thought.",
		"\"You're right, there won't be time to do that when the dominoes are falling. At the first sign of danger, they will shut the place down for good.\"",
		"\"Ah, yes. There won't be time for that once things go down. Matter of fact -- I don't think there's time for it *now*, but...\"",
		"\"Or... maybe not.\" He puts his hand to his holster. \"Either way, once we go deeper, there will be no turning back.\"",
		"\"We absolutely cannot skip that appointment.\" His face is stone. \"Consider that 100% confirmed. I fear you'll need your gun for this...\"",
		"\"Definitely. I think she knows something -- about the mercenaries, maybe. And she won't be around if the situation explodes.\"",
		"\"No -- but you're the sensitive one.\"",
		"\"You're right, however corrupt he may be, nothing happens in Martinaise without him knowing. We might have to dirty our hands, but...\"",
		"\"I still don't think that was a good idea, but, yes -- our affairs with the Wild Pines are in order. Since she isn't in Martinaise anymore.\"",
		"\"You think we should finish running it *now*?\" he whispers. \"Maybe you're right. It might not be as useful later...\"",
		"\"I don't feel it, but...\" He looks ahead, beyond the arch. \"We should still be careful. There were footprints back there. And I'm pretty sure they were fresh.\"",
		"\"I'll leave that to your judgement. You already know what I think about cross-pollinating information like this. It's dangerous, but...\"",
		"\"Definitely. It amazes me how we've managed not to... The Wild Pines has information that may be critical to our case.\"",
		"\"You mean Morell? I don't see how cryptozoology and the murder investigation are connected. But... the situation in the city will get tense for everyone.\"",
		"\"Okay -- why not. Whatever goes down might also affect her. The Union is watching her closely now...\"",
		"\"I think I see a cavern...\" The lieutenant's whisper echoes down the tunnel. \"Maybe more cellars? I think we've been careful enough -- we still have the element of surprise.\"",
		"\"Looks like our suspect -- if she's in here, we need to plan our next step carefully.\"",
		"\"Some sort of industrial ruin? I don't recognize the name of the company. R&D used to mean Research and Development... It looks long-abandoned.\"",
		"\"Okay...\" The lieutenant looks down the coast, toward the shacks. \"When you're ready, officer.\"",
		"\"Of course. Black magic. The most potent type of magic. If we're that desperate -- may I suggest getting shovels and digging?\" A quiver of a smile.",
		"He stops to consider your words. \"*Ask the wind* sounds like an expression. For when you have no idea. We should continue our search. Perhaps even get a little desperate...\"",
		"\"Right,\" he shrugs. \"How do we get in there? The doors were on the collapsed side of this building... they're gone, basically.\"",
		"\"Good, good, yes. Cold spells...\" He seems incredulous. \"So basically your *hangover* is telling you she's down there?\"",
		"\"Doesn't look like it to me.\" He pauses to study you for a moment. \"Probably not, anyway.\"",
		"\"Looks like tomorrow never came.\" The lieutenant raises the collar of his bomber jacket.",
		"The lieutenant looks at you shiver, worried suddenly. \"We should go. It gets cold if you stand in one place too long.\"",
		"\"Officer?\" The lieutenant watches you attentively. \"Are you okay? It looked like we lost you for a second.\"",
		"He stops to consider your words. \"*Ask Revachol* sounds like an expression. For when you have no idea. We should continue our search. Perhaps even get a little desperate...\"",
		"\"Anyway -- we do it the old fashioned way: sector by sector. Go over the whole peninsula, ask the locals, enter the places where we *can* enter first. Like we did in the village.\"",
		"\"How *do* we? I was really hoping she'd be in the village...\" The lieutenant sighs, then gets a hold of himself: \"Okay.\"",
		"The lieutenant clears his throat. \"Let's move on. I don't think we need to stand around anymore.\"",
		"\"She's *probably* north of the village and this place is a peninsula. I think there's people west of here, we could ask them...\" He looks to his right and cups his ear.",
		"He shrugs. \"So how do we get in there? The doors were on the collapsed side of this building... they're gone, basically.\"",
		"He looks around. \"Like -- maybe we can get shovels and dig?\" A quiver of a smile. \"Don't mind that -- a bad attempt at humour.\"",
		"\"Because I *hope* you didn't mean to climb that ladder...\" He points to the ladder next to the sign and says: \"It's *not* safe.\"",
		"\"Maybe we could, you know...\" He points to the man who points at the building, telling his son something. \"Ask the man who's pointing at the building?\"",
		"\"What? I didn't say anything.\" He looks at you. \"What are we doing here? We keep returning and you act strange.\"",
		"A shuffle of nylon as the lieutenant shrugs. \"I don't know... It's your call, detective. If you drop the radio lead now, just be prepared to live without having done it.\"",
		"\"Of course. We should continue our search.\"",
		"\"And then there's the church.\" He looks at the bell tower. \"If I were a murder suspect I would not hide in the most prominent building here, but who knows? Maybe she's reckless...\"",
		"\"Right. Well, I'm sure that after...\" The lieutenant's words come to a slow halt. He pinches the bridge of his nose.",
		"\"In case she's underground? Don't mind that -- a bad attempt at humour.\"",
		"\"True...  But how do we even get in there? The doors were on the collapsed side of this building... they're gone, basically.\"",
		"\"Perhaps *you* can climb them. *We're* not climbing anything. I'm 43 years old -- and I plan to live to see 70.\"",
		"\"Then -- if we're desperate -- we can look where we *can't* enter. Bunkers, storm drainage, this place. I'm sure it won't come to that.\" He looks behind him, at the dark red box crumbling across the chasm.",
		"\"When you're ready.\" The lieutenant nods.",
		"A shuffle of nylon as the lieutenant shrugs. \"I'm only observing that there's another lead you wanted to follow. And that if you drop the radio lead now, just be prepared to live without having done it.\"",
		"\"In there? She could. Or...\" The lieutenant points behind you. \"She could be in the *identical* ruin over there, or in that boat shack. In that church tower, maybe...\"",
		"\"Looks like tomorrow never came.\" The lieutenant raises the collar of his bomber jacket.",
		"\"You mean we should do that *right now*, don't you?\" the lieutenant asks, his usually even tone wavering slightly. \"Can that be done *after* the murder investigation?\"",
		"The lieutenant glances down the coast, toward the fishing village. \"There's also still the question of how the twins tuned into Speedfreaks FM...\"",
		"\"Okay -- why?\"",
		"\"Right. How do we get in, though? The doors were on the collapsed side of this building... they're gone, basically.\"",
		"A shuffle of nylon as the lieutenant shrugs. \"It's your call, detective. If you drop the radio lead now, just be prepared to live without having done it.\"",
		"\"I see. Political theory as detective work. Right.\" The lieutenant looks down the coast, toward the shacks. \"After you, officer.\"",
		"\"That's not how physics work, detective. And even if it were -- wouldn't you need some kind of apparatus? A teleportation field or...\"",
		"\"Okay, well. That's impressive, but...\"",
		"\"You know, for the record, you didn't teleport there. You just climbed the ladder with your eyes closed...\"",
		"He looks at you, eyes wide with feigned surprise. \"You're not? Please don't try to *climb* the building, we'll get in another way.\"",
		"\"This really has nothing to do with... adventure. We're dealing with basic physics here.\"",
		"\"Teleportation apparatus? I don't remember mentioning anything about teleportation apparatus. Please don't try to *climb* the building, we'll get in another way.\"",
		"\"Yeah, that doesn't look good at all.\"",
		"\"I just *saw* you climb the ladder,\" the lieutenant shouts from below. \"You just climbed it, like a regular person.\"",
		"\"Never mind... find a way to let me in when you get inside! Don't go adventuring without backup, especially if we think the suspect may be hiding here.\"",
		"\"Careful...\"",
		"\"Oh yes. It could hurt. A lot.\"",
		"\"Enough of that now, officer...\" The lieutenant pats you on the back. \"There has got to be a better, more *age-appropriate* way in.\"",
		"\"Teleportation is not a thing.\" The lieutenant stares at you, stone-faced.",
		"\"Okay, let's say teleportation is a thing. Wouldn't you need some kind of... scientific apparatus to create a teleportation field? You can't just do it without apparatus.\"",
		"The lieutenant looks at you with that 'I-know-you're-thinking-the-stupid-thing' look -- as you grow tired of clenching your buttocks and give up.",
		"\"Is everything all right in there, officer? Could you let me in?\"",
		"\"Yes. And it looks like some latter-day radicals were hiding out here but left a long time ago.\"",
		"\"I think the purpose of this bunker was to produce propaganda. It would have had radio equipment back then, but that's all been looted.\"",
		"\"If you wish. At any rate, looks like some Mazovians were hiding out here but left a long time ago.\"",
		"\"Well, my amnesiac friend, Mazov is the father of scientific communism. His theories about economic history greatly influenced -- some would even say *sparked* -- the Antecentennial Revolution.\"",
		"\"I won't stand in your way -- but only after we're through with this case.\"",
		"\"Half a century? This was probably part of the network of defence posts the communards built against the amphibious landing.\" He looks around.",
		"\"What most people think of as *history* has a tendency to linger in run-down neighbourhoods. Martinaise being what it is, no one has gone through the trouble of cleaning out the old bunkers.\"",
		"\"Yes, some radical -- or radicals -- were hiding out here but left a long time ago.\"",
		"\"Looks like some radical -- or radicals -- were hiding out here but left a long time ago.\"",
		"\"Millions of depictions of Mazov have been produced. They're not all connected -- besides, that looked like some student. The youths always go for this kind of stuff...\"",
		"\"Yes, I can see that. Looks like some communists were hiding out here. They left a long time ago.\"",
		"\"Yes. Looks like some latter-day radicals were hiding out here. They left a long time ago.\"",
		"\"You mean, like Ruby? No. I think we've stumbled on a piece of history.\" He looks at the dust.",
		"\"Some radical -- or radicals -- were hiding out here. They left a long time ago.\"",
		"\"It's a great place to hide, certainly, but there hasn't been anyone in here for ages.\"",
		"\"Indeed. No one could get a clear view. Well, at least we've been thorough. I like thorough.\"",
		"\"It's a great place to hide, certainly, but there hasn't been anyone here in ages.\"",
		"\"In fact -- I think we're done with this bunker.\" He looks to the exit. \"After you, officer.\"",
		"\"Either way, we need to keep an eye on him. Somewhere along the way, we might have been fed a lie or two...\"",
		"\"Maybe there's a Hardie boy we've yet to meet who acted as his accomplice? Either way, we need to keep an eye on him.\"",
		"\"No, it's dirty.\"",
		"\"I wouldn't go so far as to say that -- we have other reasons to arrest her.\" He frowns.",
		"\"We could learn a lot from this.\"",
		"\"Either way, we need to keep an eye on her.\"",
		"\"No, I don't think you are.\" He looks you straight in the eye for a moment, then sighs. \"Ask someone in your precinct if you want to be sure.\"",
		"\"Klaasje was the one who pointed the finger at Ruby. Perhaps she was trying to steer us away from herself? Or...\" He stops to think.",
		"\"There could be useful information about local operations in those notes. We have a junior sergeant at my station who's good with codes -- I can give this to her after we finish this.\"",
		"\"The head of a major Jamrock gang specializing in drug production and trafficking -- a very bad person.\"",
		"\"Could have been Titus. Then again...\" He pauses to think.",
		"\"It looks like she might have been... framed?\" The lieutenant taps on the page.",
		"\"It's good she left in a hurry. We could learn a lot from this...\"",
		"\"She was in plenty of trouble even without the murder charge.\" He looks down. \"Still, it's a nasty business.\"",
		"\"What about this 'M'?\" He points at the page you're staring at. \"Could this be La Puta Madre? Here: March 9th and March 15th.\"",
		"\"Besides, I'm not sure her life as a fugitive is going to be much better than with us.\"",
		"\"I don't think she killed the mercenary.\" The lieutenant taps on the page. \"It looks like she might have been... framed?\"",
		"\"Maybe she had an accomplice. Either way, we need to keep an eye on her.\"",
		"\"One thing is for certain: We have business back in the Whirling-in-Rags. Questions to ask. We should get to it.\"",
		"\"By the Hardie boys, by Klaasje, by us.\"",
		"\"Goddamnit...\" The lieutenant grabs his head.",
		"\"Hmh... No one mentioned *hearing* any shots. And a rifle like the one used would have been *loud*. She's right... I don't think the shot came from... the roof.\"",
		"\"She has a... point there. No one mentioned...\" The pain stops him from finishing the sentence.",
		"\"A breechloader?\"",
		"\"Hnghh...\" The lieutenant is unable to articulate his question.",
		"\"That... isn't... it...\"",
		"\"...Really?\"",
		"\"Hngh...\"",
		"The lieutenant watches her expectantly, occasionally shaking from the pain.",
		"\"No one takes a...\" -- the lieutenant winces from the pain -- \"fifteen-minute leak.\"",
		"\"I don't dispute that you have been charged with protecting the people of a particularly... challenging district. But poverty does not make one a loser -- poverty is just... poverty.\"",
		"\"Fuck me? I understand this is by no means an easy investigation, but...\"",
		"\"Yes, it can be difficult to be on the receiving end of so much distrust and outright hatred,\" he says with a sad half-smile.",
		"He watches your meltdown stoically from behind the lenses of his glasses.",
		"\"It is,\" the lieutenant remarks. \"However, we should definitely get the key from this 'Mañana' Evrart mentioned. That would drastically increase our credibility.\"",
		"The lieutenant merely nods in response.",
		"\"That's probably the door Evrart mentioned. We still need to get the key from this Mañana first though.\"",
		"\"Let's be honest, this isn't what I joined the RCM for. But -- every day tells you something new about yourself...\" the lieutenant replies, still inspecting the padded door.",
		"\"Yes, presenting a fabrication is known to get results here and there.\" He crosses his arms. \"You took this task. You make the call.\"",
		"\"Apparently, working with the local Union boss to get info on an investigation is not something I'm squeamish about.\"",
		"\"That already defeats the point, doesn't it?\" The lieutenant glances at the surrounding windows. \"Let's get out of here.\"",
		"The lieutenant looks first at the door, then back at you, then signals you to back off from the door.",
		"\"That's probably the door Evrart mentioned. We still need to get the key from this Mañana first though.\"",
		"\"We should leave,\" the lieutenant whispers, \"and go talk with Evrart, tell him what happened -- that we couldn't open the door. Maybe there's a workaround.\"",
		"\"On the other hand...\" He looks at the surrounding windows uncomfortably. \"We *could* just leave and tell Evrart we opened the door. No one seems to be tailing us to see if we actually did it.\"",
		"\"I mind that a local thug is using the RCM for his busywork, but if this gets us to the bottom of this hanging then I'm willing to look over it.\"",
		"\"As I already said,\" the lieutenant replies, adjusting his glasses. \"I understand this can't be avoided.\"",
		"\"If the merc tribunal happens before we solve this...\" His eyes meet yours. \"We're looking at casualties. What's one unlocked door compared to that?\"",
		"\"But we do need to get the key from this 'Mañana' Evrart mentioned.\" The lieutenant glances at the door. \"Cause we are *not* gonna break the lock.\"",
		"\"I guess no one is in.\" The lieutenant looks uncomfortable.",
		"\"I'll let you handle that side of things. You're doing just fine.\"",
		"\"Well, detective, it appears you've solved the case...\" The lieutenant looks around, writes something in his notebook, and turns to you...",
		"\"Instead, it was a kid's prank.\" He shrugs. \"But what do I know?\"",
		"He shrugs. \"But what do I know?\"",
		"\"Well, detective, it appears you're on the way to solving the case...\" The lieutenant looks around, writes something in his notebook, and turns to you...",
		"\"The missing locust case, which is a sub-case of the imaginary insect case. So at least *that's* going well.\"",
		"\"Of course. I'll leave that to you. You seem to have a *handle* on the phasmid-trap-insect situation.\"",
		"\"Oh, I'm not being sarcastic *at all*. We are making *real* progress here.\"",
		"\"Of the locusts. For the missing locust case, which is a sub-case of the imaginary insect case. So at least *that's* going well.\"",
		"\"If anything, the presence of the locusts points to the opposite -- the phasmid did not take the bait from the traps. It was Cuno. The phasmid doesn't exist...\"",
		"\"If anything, the presence of the locusts points to the *opposite* -- the phasmid did not take the bait from the traps.\"",
		"\"I'll let you handle the Cuno side of things. You're doing just fine.\"",
		"\"Yes.\" He nods. \"I feel we are nearing a *real* breakthrough.\"",
		"\"Is this really the time, detective?\"",
		"\"It's been a long winter... Long and cold.\"",
		"\"Right. I just wish I could remember what I was talking about...\"",
		"\"It's been a long winter... Long and cold.\"",
		"\"I didn't say anything, detective.\"",
		"\"Glad that stuff came in handy after all...\"",
		"\"But someone has been maintaining it. The wiring has been repaired...\"",
		"\"It's cold now...\"",
		"\"Yes, you're a natural gymnast, detective. Now would you like to do what you got up there to do?\"",
		"\"... a long winter... Long and cold...\"",
		"\"It's done. I believe we're ready.\" The lieutenant wipes his brow.",
		"\"... It's been a long winter... Long and cold...\"",
		"\"You actually haven't. But you have proven that you're a relatively capable climber.\"",
		"\"It's been a long winter... Long and cold.\"",
		"\"Mention what?\"",
		"\"It's been a long winter... Long and cold.\"",
		"\"... someone has been maintaining it...\" The lieutenant's voice suddenly grows faint and distant, as though he were speaking from a passing motor carriage...",
		"\"Ah, yes, of course. That must be it...\"",
		"\"... someone has been maintaining it...\"",
		"\"Everything in order, detective? You're really giving Filippe III a stare.\"",
		"\"There is no way *that* is going to make any difference...\"",
		"The lieutenant looks up at you with a nervous glance.",
		"\"...someone has been maintaining it. The wiring has been repaired...\"",
		"\"I promise you, I didn't, even though it certainly *sounds* like me...\" The lieutenant seems to wince at the sound of his own voice.",
		"\"I can assure you, it's not my 'twin brother'. Though it certainly does *sound* like me...\" The lieutenant seems to wince at the sound of his own voice.",
		"\"The connections look fine to me.\"",
		"\"...someone has been maintaining it. The wiring has been repaired...\"",
		"\"I'm absolutely okay with not having one.\"",
		"\"Probably because of how *non-verbal* their mode of operation is going to be,\" the lieutenant answers for the two rebels. \"It's a threat.\"",
		"\"You wanna talk? Let's talk, boys.\" His eyes meet yours. \"Ask them.\"",
		"\"Wow, you boys are ambitious,\" the lieutenant's voice rings over the plaza. \"Only *prospects* and already planning a coup in the SKULLS? You're destined to go far!\"",
		"\"Yes?\"",
		"\"That's okay. I wouldn't wear either one anyway.\"",
		"\"The Union does their share of policing in Martinaise, at least where gangs are concerned,\" the lieutenant replies instead. \"That's why there isn't much organized crime around here.\"",
		"\"Don't *well* me. This might be fine by you but it certainly isn't fine by me. We've got to try to nip this kind of behaviour in the bud.\"",
		"\"What is?\"",
		"The lieutenant raises an eyebrow but does not comment.",
		"\"Do. I'm fine with that.\"",
		"\"I already *am* expressing my individuality.\"",
		"\"The need will not arise.\"",
		"\"The need will not arise.\"",
		"The lieutenant looks down at his bomber jacket and shrugs, obviously content with *his* uniform.",
		"The lieutenant sighs. \"No, they really, really aren't. It's porno-tuning. Say no to the porno.\"",
		"\"Ahem.\" He steps in. \"While I appreciate the interest you take in my *brutal motor carriage*, I have to stop you right there. The RCM takes threats directed at its property seriously.\"",
		"\"They usually occupy the Burnt-Out Quarter in Jamrock. Or you can find them loitering around their brightly-painted, bottom-lighted vehicles.\"",
		"\"The concept of getting dressed *is* familiar to me, but wearing jackets like these isn't appropriate for an RCM officer. Unless he's *deep* undercover,\" he adds.",
		"\"I don't think this case requires us to go undercover. Or raise hell...  In fact I don't think the jacket will be useful at all.\"",
		"\"If you say so.\"",
		"\"If a SKULL spots you, he will pull out his dagger and stab you without saying a single word.\"",
		"The lieutenant sighs. \"I... appreciate the effort.\"",
		"\"The Union does their share of policing in Martinaise, at least where gangs are concerned,\" the lieutenant replies instead. \"That's why there isn't much organized crime around here.\"",
		"\"That's gallant of you, but I'm not wearing either jacket.\"",
		"\"It's a threat,\" the lieutenant answers for the two rebels. \"An impotent threat of violence.\"",
		"\"You punched a twelve-year-old boy in the face. I think I'm still pretty much in the clear here,\" the lieutenant replies. There's is no discernible change in his tone.",
		"\"No, I don't. What are you implying?\"",
		"\"I already *am* expressing my individuality.\"",
		"\"If you got something else to ask from them, do it now and let's move on. I don't want to waste any more time here.\"",
		"\"I don't think this case requires us to go undercover. Or raise hell... In fact I don't think the jacket will be useful at all.\"",
		"\"And do what? Walk away, knowing that there are two delusional hoodlums interested in joining a criminal group whose main areas of expertise are jacking cars and killing police officers?\"",
		"\"What are you implying?\" The lieutenant looks confused.",
		"\"Fine, if only to end this discussion: Theoretically, if I were a juvenile delinquent -- if I were to already be down that path -- I think 'PISSF****T' is the stronger of the two statements.\"",
		"\"I'm not wearing that jacket.\"",
		"\"I already *am* expressing my individuality.\"",
		"The lieutenant notices your agitation and opens his mouth to speak, but then decides against it and merely shakes his head.",
		"\"Fine,\" the lieutenant shrugs. \"'FUCK THE WORLD' just seemed to fit you more, considering your... heroic exit attempts.\"",
		"\"Pick a better time, officer.\" The lieutenant's voice rings cold and certain. \"*After* we've dealt with these wannabe cop-killers.\"",
		"\"These punks don't know anything. Let's just move along.\"",
		"\"Seems about right,\" the lieutenant remarks. \"Especially considering your... heroic exit attempts.\"",
		"The lieutenant sighs. \"We should move along.\"",
		"\"Good -- I wanted you *not* to express yours.\"",
		"\"You tried to punch a twelve year old and almost knocked yourself out,\" the lieutenant replies with no discernible change in his tone. \"I think I'm still pretty much in the clear here.\"",
		"\"They're called SKULLS because when you're shot dead in the middle of the street, the skull is the only part the stray dogs won't eat.\"",
		"\"You wanted to know which jacket I'd wear, right? Neither. I'd wear neither.\"",
		"\"I'm absolutely okay with not having either one, thank you.\"",
		"\"Leather jackets adorned with immature writing? The 'ideology' they convey helps the boys justify poor choices in life and fashion.\" The lieutenant shrugs. \"I'm not a fan.\"",
		"\"For what?\"",
		"\"It's not shit, it's disco...\"",
		"\"This is ridiculous.\" The lieutenant gives you an irritated glance. \"Boys, do you know why the gang is called SKULLS?\"",
		"\"You fired a gun at a little girl,\" the lieutenant replies with no discernible change in his tone. \"I think I've got a *little* bit of wiggling room here.\"",
		"\"I'm not sure I understand you, detective.\"",
		"The lieutenant sighs.",
		"\"Do. I'm fine with that.\"",
		"\"You aimed a loaded gun at little girl,\" the lieutenant replies with no discernible change in his tone. \"I think I've got a *little* bit of wiggling room here.\"",
		"\"Neither.\"",
		"\"No. You don't get to say that.\" His voice is sharp as a blade. \"Police officers put their lives on the line to protect the people of Revachol, while punks like these joke about joining a cop-killer clan.\"",
		"\"I wouldn't wear it anyway.\"",
		"\"This case doesn't requires us to go undercover. Or raise hell... In fact I don't think the jackets will be useful at all. I just wanted *them* to not have them anymore.\"",
		"\"But I don't,\" the lieutenant interjects quickly. \"In fact I dislike them so much I'm willing to drag you boys back to the station just to calm myself down.\"",
		"\"No, he won't.\"",
		"\"That's okay. I'm not wearing that jacket.\"",
		"\"Don't say anything.\" He turns away from you. \"Just let them go.\"",
		"\"Right.\" Lieutenant Kitsuragi adjusts his spectacles. \"You heard the detective. He's gonna ask you some questions now.\"",
		"\"You do? Because I don't.\"",
		"\"Now is not the time to get philosophical, detective. You can do that after hours.\"",
		"The smile disappears. \"You can't be serious.\"",
		"\"Damn it, now you've got *me* curious... this is *not* what we came to the harbour for.\"",
		"The lieutenant considers this for a moment. \"There may very well be, but we're not here to look for that.\"",
		"\"We're not here to interact with containers -- we're here to interview the Union boss.\"",
		"The lieutenant nods. \"Are you satisfied, detective?\"",
		"\"Why are you what?\" The lieutenant looks startled.",
		"\"We're not here to interact with containers -- we're here to get the body down from the tree.\"",
		"\"I don't hear anything.\" The lieutenant cups one of his ears.",
		"\"There are a million containers here. Why are you fixating on this one?\"",
		"\"We're not here to interact with containers -- we're here to talk to the Union, right?\"",
		"\"It's a cargo container, detective. Just like all the others.\" He doesn't even look at it.",
		"\"You just picked one out, because you wanted to interact with a cargo container.\"",
		"\"Because what wasn't an option?\" The lieutenant looks startled.",
		"The lieutenant sighs. \"Is this like your thing with that wall again?\"",
		"\"Satisfied, detective?\" A wry smile crosses the lieutenant's face.",
		"\"Could you please stop asking *everyone* for money? It does not reflect well on the RCM and to be perfectly frank we can't afford to look worse than we already do.\"",
		"\"No, I am *not* having a stroke. You're just... still full of surprises. Most of them bad, but some good...\"",
		"\"I guess the inordinate amount of time they poured into drawing mythical creatures did not generate a return on investment.\"",
		"\"It is not...\" The lieutenant stops to rub his temples. \"Never mind.\"",
		"\"Not the blaasma gun again.\" The lieutenant takes off the glasses and rubs his eyes with his fingers. \"It's not even *possible*.\"",
		"\"If you ask me, he's only serving one of them thus far,\" the lieutenant mutters, half to himself.",
		"\"Oh, nothing. It's just that we've got this *murder* to solve, and yet you go around asking everyone about *money*. And every time I ask, 'Are you sure this is related to the case?', you say, 'Sure, Kim. I think it is'...\"",
		"\"I am not *un*-impressed. Let's leave it at that.\"",
		"\"I see nothing of the sort. To be frank, all I see is a gentleman who's unusually well dressed for Martinaise. In a cargo container. Which, I admit, is odd.\"",
		"\"If I could interject: the RCM's problems are mainly *structural*. We're hamstrung by a lack of clear lines of authority, and our system of performance reviews strongly *disincentivizes* inter-precinct cooperation.\"",
		"\"Mr. Diodore, I am Lieutenant Kim Kitsuragi of the RCM, and this is my partner...\"",
		"\"And yet it never seems to get us any closer to solving the case.\"",
		"\"We have a *murder* to solve, and yet you go around bothering everyone about *money*, arguing that you think it's 'somehow related to the case.'\"",
		"\"I can assure you, Mr. Diodore, that despite his vices he is a competent detective.\"",
		"The lieutenant looks at you with horror. You've been mumbling to your necktie in a daze for several minutes.",
		"\"Yes, yes! That's *precisely* what we need.\"",
		"The lieutenant's disappointment is palpable. It's like someone just shot his dog.",
		"Even the lieutenant looks tense, waiting to see where this is going...",
		"\"I can assure you, Mr. Diodore, that despite his vices he is a competent detective.\"",
		"\"Could you please stop asking people for money? It does not reflect well on the RCM and to be perfectly frank we can't afford to look worse than we already do.\"",
		"\"What the detective means is that we're in Martinaise, a subdistrict of Jamrock in the capital city of Revachol.\"",
		"\"He should what?\"",
		"The lieutenant stands there, dumbfounded. His mouth opens slightly, then closes again.",
		"\"Yes. I'm alright.\" He pauses to compose himself. \"Can we get going now?\"",
		"The lieutenant seems *very* relieved.",
		"\"You would not even believe,\" the lieutenant mutters to himself.",
		"The lieutenant leans in and whispers to you: \"Please, behave yourself.\"",
		"\"If you ask me, he's only serving one of them thus far,\" the lieutenant mutters, half to himself.",
		"\"Oh, lord, not this again.\"",
		"\"Just a minute. The RCM has its difficulties, but generally speaking--\"",
		"\"I don't see how it's appropriate for a representative of the law to ask a wealthy person for money. This shines a... bad light on the RCM, if you catch my meaning.\"",
		"\"Good luck. You will not get information on a confidential operation from your station secretary just by calling. If you really don't remember -- it might be better to keep this one forgotten.\"",
		"\"If this man was really here when it happened, then it's better for all of us that he doesn't remember what happened.\"",
		"\"That she is. A great sacral piece. I wonder what we're doing here, however...\" He takes his glasses off to clean them.",
		"As that great and desperate thought passes through your mind, the lieutenant draws an x-shaped cross from shoulder to shoulder.",
		"\"What are you thinking of, if I may ask?\"",
		"\"She introduced us to the idea of public education, retirement, and modern diplomacy.\" He takes his glasses off to clean them.",
		"As that useless word passes through your mind, the lieutenant draws an x-shaped cross from shoulder to shoulder.",
		"\"Ice cool,\" the lieutenant nods.",
		"\"I'm sorry, I'm not saying you were...\" There's a pause. \"It was a clandestine operation. I don't know anything about it. Why it was conducted or who participated. I try not to pry into extra-district matters.\"",
		"\"We should be respectful here, although the building appears to be deserted. We have already found the instigator -- I'm not sure what else we could want from here...\" He looks around.",
		"\"So do I.\"",
		"\"None of this is, in fact. This church. The coast... This isn't a good place to get lost in.\"",
		"As that terrible word passes through your mind, the lieutenant draws an x-shaped cross from shoulder to shoulder.",
		"\"I am pretty sure it was a clandestine operation. I don't know anything more about it. Why it was conducted, or who participated... I try not to pry into extra-district matters.\"",
		"\"Either way... this church, we shouldn't linger here. This isn't a good place to get lost in.\"",
		"\"Okay...\" He takes his glasses off to clean them. Then, after a while, he says:",
		"\"In this church I mean? The coast in general... we shouldn't linger. This isn't a good place to get lost in.\"",
		"As that bitter thought passes through your head, the lieutenant draws an x-shaped cross from shoulder to shoulder. With three fingers.",
		"\"I agree. It happened a while ago. It's unimportant to our business in Martinaise now.\"",
		"\"Officer, you've stood there for over five minutes...\" The lieutenant's calm voice echoes in the cold air of the church.",
		"As that soft word passes through your mind, the lieutenant draws an x-shaped cross from shoulder to shoulder.",
		"\"The old woman in the village was being tactful with us when she didn't mention it. She has more respect for the RCM than many around here.\"",
		"\"It happened a while ago. It's unimportant to our business in Martinaise now.\"",
		"\"It's Dolores Dei...\" he says in a hushed voice. \"The old woman was right. This is the Dolorian Church of Humanity in Martinaise. Or the Small Pinewood Church in some records.\"",
		"\"She's been dead for three hundred years. I am almost a thousand percent certain she isn't connected to the case...\" He takes his glasses off to clean them.",
		"\"We should be respectful here, although the building appears to be deserted. I do not believe we'll find anything connected to the lynching here. Something else, perhaps...\" He looks at the machinery lying around.",
		"\"Three Precincts were involved in the raid and people say Precinct 41 was one of them.\"",
		"\"The old woman in the village was right...\" He looks around. \"This must be the Dolorian Church of Humanity in Martinaise -- or the Small Pinewood Church in some records...\"",
		"\"There used to be seven stave churches on the coast. Les Sept Soeurs they call them -- The Seven Sisters. Only one remains. The rest were burnt in the Revolution, or used for building materials.\"",
		"\"'Justice, Union, Prudence, and Force'.\"",
		"\"Yes. Glowing lungs are quite unusual. After that one time, they have not been reported to glow.\" He takes his glasses off to clean them.",
		"\"Okay. It's just that you've been looking at that window for quite long now. And it's cold in here...\" He takes off his glasses to clean them.",
		"\"It's not spiritual. It's constitutional. The Dolorian system does not demand faith -- only accordance.\"",
		"\"It was deemed *subservient* to use a strongly Moralintern-related motto. We're already suspected of bootlicking. The sentence was also seen as... too feminine. It was a macho thing.\"",
		"\"Yes.\" He looks around. \"I wasn't sure before, but this must be the Dolorian Church of Humanity in Martinaise -- it's called the Small Pinewood Church in some records...\"",
		"\"I do.\" There's a pause, then he continues: \"I heard it was a particularly bad one. The place was shot to pieces.\"",
		"\"You know... this church. The coast... we shouldn't linger. Finish what you came here to do and let's move on. This isn't a good place to get lost in.\"",
		"\"I have a theory, yes.\" There's a pause, then he continues: \"There was a police raid a while back. I heard the place was shot to pieces.\"",
		"\"Well... your station was involved, I hear. Although I can't be sure.\"",
		"\"This exaltation is common in Dolorian sacralism. In the early years it was even incorporated as the RCM's slogan. No more, however.\"",
		"\"This church. The coast in general... we shouldn't linger here. This isn't a good place to get lost in.\"",
		"\"We should be respectful here, although the building appears to be deserted. I do not believe we'll find the instigator here. Something else, perhaps...\" He looks at the machinery lying around.",
		"\"...death, life again,\" he nods. \"After the world, the pale; after the pale -- the world again.\"",
		"\"You are brutal and *dumb*.\" He says, his voice ice cold.",
		"\"Either way -- this church, the coast in general... we shouldn't linger here. This isn't a good place to get lost in. We should conclude our business and move on.\"",
		"\"I don't know about that...\" He takes his glasses off to clean them. \"It was a different time. A different war.\"",
		"\"Okey-doe-doe,\" he whispers in the silence of the great building.",
		"\"I assure you, I'm not.\" He looks up at the stained glass window.",
		"\"Yes. We all are. Her name, body, and rule are synonymous with humanism. The laws we enforce are Dolorian in origin.\"",
		"\"It's Dolores Dei...\" he says in a hushed voice. \"I believe we are in the Dolorian Church of Humanity in Martinaise. Or the Small Pinewood Church in some records.\"",
		"\"Not at all.\"",
		"\"It's a minor landmark, not easy to find. Most maps misplace it...\" He lowers his voice. \"It was built not long after Revachol's founding, 300 or so years ago by first-generation settlers.\"",
		"\"I have no idea what you mean by that. We've been standing here long enough. We should look around, or get out.\"",
		"\"This church. The coast in general... we shouldn't linger here. This isn't a good place to get lost in. We should conclude our business and move on.\"",
		"\"Not as a general rule, but that one was justified. Better to get the lay of the land before telling people to fuck off.\"",
		"\"We should return to the murder case. See what Joyce tells us about the lynching. When we're done for the day, I'll call my station and suggest our narcotics department look into it.\"",
		"\"And last but not least, it looks like the Hardie boys knew this driver, as we know that she was present at the lynching. This may be the Union connection we've been searching for.\"",
		"\"I'm going to say -- no.\"",
		"\"We didn't find anything *conclusive* linking them to the smuggling operation, but somehow I doubt that Evrart Claire would be oblivious to something like this happening right under his nose.\"",
		"\"And last but not least, it's *Ruby's cabin* we found. This is an undeniable connection to the Union.\"",
		"\"I'm especially intrigued by that radio transmitter -- particularly the sheer number of stations it can connect. Looks like this alleged drug trade casts a wide net.\"",
		"\"Honestly, I'm quite worried by what we've seen so far. The evidence seems to point to a rather extensive and well-organized operation.\"",
		"\"Perhaps you're right...\" He stops to think. \"This is one connection I find a little dubious, to be honest. I prefer not to profile people's emotions. Perhaps it's because I'm not very good at it, but still.\"",
		"\"One way or another, they seem to be -- logistically, if nothing else. But don't expect to bust this open during our stay here. At best, this is an angle we can use against them. To other ends. As extra ammunition.\"",
		"\"I'm not sure what the ULAN frequencies are all about, but they may hold some significance. Perhaps it's a better way to connect between fleets while avoiding frequency bleed, or maybe it's used to tap into RCM networks...\"",
		"\"My suggestion is -- we use it against the Union in any way we can. To our own ends. It's a slippery eel, but we just might be able to pin them down *indirectly*. Down the road.\"",
		"\"As... *elegant* as they are, I don't think they are relevant to the drug trade.\"",
		"\"There are more than enough grounds to start an official investigation -- some time later, when we're done here. We do *not* want to get caught in that...\" He stops to think.",
		"\"Yes, well...\" He doesn't say more.",
		"\"Like Joyce told us, yes -- logistically. But don't expect to bust this open during our stay here. At best, this is an angle we can use against them. To other ends. As extra ammunition.\"",
		"\"The fact that one hasn't started already gives me pause. An investigation, I mean. Especially if the Madre grouping is involved... and I can't imagine they aren't. It's certainly worrisome.\"",
		"The lieutenant nods -- but he's not happy.",
		"\"Oh, and the maps we found. They reveal the *geographical* extent of the operation -- looks like they've used abandoned tunnels and access roads to stay hidden. This is useful info.\"",
		"He nods. \"All the same, I don't like the idea of Internal Affairs descending on the matter. That won't help anyone either.\"",
		"\"Debrief over,\" he nods. \"After you.\"",
		"\"Tore it to pieces.\"",
		"\"Unfortunately, I can confirm that.\"",
		"\"Anyway...\" He looks around, a little embarrassed of the enthusiasm of his interjection.",
		"\"That would depend on the circumstances.\" The lieutenant taps his foot.",
		"\"I understand. People are usually afraid to do things if others aren't already doing them. Dancing makes you dance like sneezing makes you sneeze. Or yawning makes you...\"",
		"\"Yeah. Drugs. Shit. Fuck. We don't care.\" He smirks.",
		"\"Yes, I suppose we did.\"",
		"\"Khm...\" The lieutenant steps in. \"Faubourg -- not *In Faubourg* -- is a massive banlieue south of Jamrock Quarter. It is the largest ghetto in Revachol -- possibly the world.\"",
		"\"Take this, you're cold.\" The lieutenant begins to take off his jacket.",
		"\"Agreed,\" the lieutenant notes.",
		"\"We're Jamrock. Sort of. Martinaise is called North Jamrock sometimes. Jamrock is also a ghetto, only smaller than Faubourg.\"",
		"\"It's okay.\" The lieutenant backs up. He throws you a glance.",
		"\"Good call, detective,\" he says, still looking at the ocean. \"You can lose your mind trying to mediate everything these delinquents come up with. Fate will take care of it for us.\"",
		"\"No. Conduct your side-interview and let's move on to the case at hand.\"",
		"\"This is why I didn't go into the tent.\" The lieutenant looks at the ocean, squinting his eyes. \"Typical delinquency.\"",
		"\"Please officer, just finish your side-interview. We need to move on to the case at hand.\"",
		"\"As good a call as any...\" the lieutenant says, still looking at the ocean. \"Better not to have made one at all though. You'll lose your mind trying to mediate everything these delinquents come up with.\"",
		"\"Like a *crab*, you say?\" The lieutenant nods. His face is stone.",
		"\"Okay. Now conduct your side-interview and let's move on to the case at hand.\"",
		"\"A crab *and* a banger?\" The lieutenant raises an eyebrow.",
		"\"Wonderful,\" the lieutenant says, still looking at the ocean. \"Revachol really needed another cop-for-hire. Maybe later we can go and get some doughnuts?\"",
		"The lieutenant eyes you suspiciously.",
		"\"I can see there's more to this story, detective,\" he says quietly. \"But you're not the first corrupt cop in the RCM.\"",
		"\"It's not the beat, he was *shot*,\" the lieutenant says, irritated.",
		"Then a breath of cold sea air fills the church as the lieutenant opens the door and steps out.",
		"\"Yeah...\" The lieutenant snorts. \"Whatever.\"",
		"\"Now check *this* shit out!\"",
		"\"What happened? Are you feeling alright?\"",
		"The lieutenant begins to heel-kick the church floor with such intensity, it's reasonable to fear he'll kick a hole right through it, causing the floor to crack and the pillars to collapse, bringing the church roof down on all of you.",
		"The lieutenant squeezes the bridge of his nose. The lights reflect off his glasses...",
		"\"Dance?\" he repeats. \"*Monkey* fucker?\"",
		"\"Are you kidding me?!\"",
		"\"That's all great, but we should really get going. We've spent enough time doing aerobic exercise for today.\"",
		"He nods. \"That seems likely. Can you stand?\"",
		"\"The what now?\" The lieutenant suddenly stops. \"The sound above your *what*?\"",
		"\"Good for you!\" He looks around the church hall. \"Rock on, then...\"",
		"\"Had a good rest there?\"",
		"\"Sheesh, okay...\" He backs up with his hands raised in the air, observing the criss-cross of your feet...",
		"The lieutenant taps his foot and looks at his wristwatch. He doesn't seem pleased with this waste of time.",
		"\"Oh, c'mon...\"",
		"\"WHAT'S HAPPENING?!\" The lieutenant is forced to yell over the futuristic music blasting from the speakers.",
		"The lieutenant squeezes the bridge of his nose. The lights reflect off his glasses, giving him the appearance of a surgeon in the middle of a tense procedure...",
		"\"Oh yeah? I did 15 years in the Juvenile Crime Unit. I can *do* age-inappropriate.\"",
		"\"Excuse me, *what*?\"",
		"\"That all you got? I did 15 years in the Juvenile Crime Unit. I can *do* age-inappropriate.\"",
		"\"A Code 31 emergency? Really?\"",
		"\"What?\" The lieutenant leans closer, unable to make out your words over the pumping beats. \"Cut a *what*?\"",
		"\"We're done.\"",
		"The lieutenant crosses his arms with a bemused look.",
		"\"Dance? Yellow?\" He pauses to look at you with tired eyes. \"*Monkey fucker*?\"",
		"\"Has anything like this happened to you before?\"",
		"\"It looks pretty dangerous, though.\"",
		"\"I hope you're not trying to dance with that leg of yours,\" the lieutenant says, worried. \"Healing from a gunshot wound takes time and patience. Be careful.\"",
		"\"What?\"",
		"\"Okay, you psychopath...\" He adjusts his spectacles, then pops his collar as high as it will go. \"I see what you're doing there. It's jacked-up footwork, plus some... Is that Ubi folk dancing?\"",
		"He looks down, then at you.",
		"\"So...\" He looks at you with mild concern. \"We should get going maybe?\"",
		"\"Okay, this is too imbecilic. Excuse me.\"",
		"\"What's going on here?\" The lieutenant looks at you and the speedfreaks grinding around in the church, a group of unhinged lunatics. \"Delinquents,\" he grumbles.",
		"\"WHAT'S HAPPENING?!\" The lieutenant is forced to yell over the futuristic music blasting from the speakers. \"HOW THE HELL ARE YOU DANCING WITH THAT BROKEN LEG OF YOURS?\"",
		"\"It's his leg. Did you know he was *shot* just a few days ago? He shouldn't be dancing like a madman, he should be in bed, *resting*.\"",
		"\"Hard core, *shmard core*... I did 15 years in the Juvenile Crime Unit. I can *do* age-inappropriate.\"",
		"Then a breath of cold sea air fills the church as the lieutenant opens the door and steps out.",
		"\"That's all great, but we should really get going. We've spent enough time doing aerobic exercise for today.\"",
		"The lieutenant sighs. \"Alright, party-boy, can you stand?\"",
		"\"Get my *what* on?\" The lieutenant leans closer, unable to make out your words over the pumping beats.",
		"Waking up, you see the lieutenant talking to the young people, a worried look on his face.",
		"He ignores the young man. \"It very well could be that something similar happened the night you lost your memory. Can you stand?\"",
		"\"There must be some other way. Let's go see the yard again -- it faces the other end of the harbour. We're done with Measurehead here.\"",
		"The lieutenant groans, but doesn't say anything.",
		"\"We're not here on some political quest, we're here to solve a crime. Don't make this situation any more volatile than it already is.\"",
		"He nods. \"Let's think of something else.\"",
		"\"I'm not even sure the *one bullet* my chamber holds would even prick that hulk.\"",
		"\"And you're just going to *let* him manipulate you like that?\" He raises an eyebrow.",
		"\"Smooth move, operator.\" He looks to his wristwatch. \"We done here?\"",
		"\"Had enough assaulting *madre natura*?\" He looks at his wristwatch. \"We should get moving.\"",
		"\"Yes. 'One day, grass will grow over our cities' and so on...\" He looks at the tree. \"Very poetic. Better not to dwell on it -- what with a murder to solve and all.\"",
		"The lieutenant looks at you mumbling at the tree, then at his wristwatch. \"Maybe we should get back to the case.\"",
		"\"You could also get it fixed at the pawnshop across the street -- we shouldn't waste our time.\" He looks at his wristwatch a little impatiently.",
		"\"Alright.\" Looks like the lieutenant doesn't really know what that means. \"You could also get it fixed at the pawnshop across the street -- we shouldn't waste our time.\"",
		"He looks at his wristwatch a little impatiently. \"You know, since tape-spinning isn't really our day job. Solving murder investigations is.\"",
		"\"This is part of your church-thing, isn't it? Of course it is. It's too broken to play, you understand, right? It's not like Egg Head and his friends know how to fix it.\"",
		"\"You put your hand on a tree with sharp thorns, what did you think was going to happen?\"",
		"The lieutenant looks at the mess in your hands. Only after you've successfully cleaned up the branches does the curiosity get him: \"What's the tape for?\" he asks.",
		"\"How? It's broken and unspooled. Do you think your new buddy knows how to fix it?\"",
		"\"Right. I don't really want to hear about what happened in the tent. Let's get going.\"",
		"\"What a shame. Look at all the damage done to the church...\"",
		"\"Hmm... I heard about the assault after it had already gone down.\"",
		"\"Please, detective, not this again.\"",
		"\"Officer, is there something up there?\" The lieutenant follows your gaze, attempting to see whatever it is that you are seeing.",
		"\"I wonder why the... church was built with such strange acoustics...\"",
		"The lieutenant doesn't reply, but you can sense him tense up next to you.",
		"\"The church just has... strange acoustics -- some engineering trick.\"",
		"The lieutenant points to his ears and shakes his head. Then he leans closer.",
		"\"Officer, what are you looking at?\" He follows your gaze, attempting to see whatever it is that you are seeing.",
		"\"Hmm, could be...\"",
		"\"Can you hear anything?\"",
		"\"Hmm, maybe. Darkness often has that effect on people.\"",
		"You hear the lieutenant suppress an almighty scoff.",
		"\"We really haven't got time for this,\" the lieutenant says, getting impatient. \"In case you've forgotten, we're supposed to be investigating a murder.\"",
		"\"I have to agree. We barely have what we need to solve the case we've got now. We can't afford to run around chasing after quasi-mythical pieces of drug paraphernalia...\"",
		"\"Yes, they have,\" the lieutenant says, unamused.",
		"\"I don't know where he picked up these views, but wherever it was, he seems to be sincere about them.\"",
		"\"Why didn't you go to the authorities?\"",
		"\"'Count C,' for its popularity among the aristocratic class of the prior century...\"",
		"\"Thank you for your services, gentlemen.\" He turns to you. \"Should we go and mail this? I think I saw a mailbox on the plaza.\"",
		"\"'Awful' is very strong, Tequila. You're gonna have to explain how I missed the mark by *so much* if that's the case. What don't you like about it?\"",
		"\"Hmmm, this wouldn't be the Deponte-Delgado case, would it?\"",
		"\"It's an okay jacket.\" The lieutenant shrugs. \"If you're into that look.\"",
		"\"Wow. That's *quite* a story.\"",
		"\"Thank you for your help.\" He turns to you. \"Should we go and mail this? I think I saw a mailbox on the plaza.\"",
		"The lieutenant massages his temples and looks down at the ground.",
		"The lieutenant's brow is furrowed. He's listening as casually as he can.",
		"\"Naturally, Ulla Deponte became the prime suspect in the disappearance of Eva Delgado. Deponte maintained that it was the so-called 'Headless FALN Rider' and that she ran, fearing for her life...\" He adjusts his glasses.",
		"\"Oh, dear god,\" the lieutenant says, his palm rising to meet his face.",
		"\"But we *haven't* solved the murder yet,\" the lieutenant says. \"We might have if you hadn't gotten distracted by this.\"",
		"\"Not this again. I was hoping that we were done with it.\"",
		"The lieutenant smirks. \"He won't though, because it's just a stupid legend.\"",
		"\"Besides, it would look *extremely* bad for the RCM to be caught up in something that has the word *COCAINE* writ large on it. The PR is tricky on this.\"",
		"\"I thought that he rode a headless pig?\" The lieutenant says with a little smirk.",
		"\"No. She committed suicide before she could be taken into custody. They found her in the bathroom with a rifle, her face slowly peeling off the ceiling...\"",
		"\"At least you got a nice jacket for your troubles.\" The lieutenant shrugs.",
		"The lieutenant's brow is furrowed. He's listening as casually as he can.",
		"\"I think that we should let him continue with the story.\"",
		"\"Or maybe it's in the *air*? Or in an ancient steppe pyramid off shore?\"",
		"\"A lot of cops go *solo* and *hermit* once they reach that level of alcoholism.\"",
		"\"I've read the case file. But please, go on.\"",
		"\"During the investigation it became apparent that there was a love triangle, the third party being some small-time businessman -- I don't remember the exact details. The leading theory was that an argument broke out on the jetty and Deponte pushed Delgado into the canal, then cooked up this stupid cover story.\"",
		"\"If you only knew.\"",
		"\"Hard to argue with that, I suppose.\"",
		"The lieutenant is about to say something, but gets cut off...",
		"\"You're aware that monument is *supposed* to look like it's exploding? It doesn't need renovating.\"",
		"\"This is ludicrous.\" The lieutenant turns to you. \"And physically impossible. Sinuses can't contain that amount of anything.\"",
		"\"The kids on the street also call it 'snow day'...\"",
		"The lieutenant sits silent the entire time, preferring to focus on his notebook.",
		"The lieutenant closes his notebook and nods at you, ready to go.",
		"\"That part at least more or less corresponds to the case file.\"",
		"The lieutenant inspects the jacket in your hands. \"You know, despite the *guano* it looks like the jacket itself is stain-resistant. It may just need a good scrubbing.\"",
		"\"The junkies, for some reason, are pretty upfront about it. They just say they're looking to snort some blow out of a dead man's nasal cavity.\"",
		"\"That's alright. We've got plenty of adventures for one case.\"",
		"\"Not a pretty scene.\"",
		"\"Okay, let's step aside for a second, I have something I want to talk about.\"",
		"\"Mhm...\" The lieutenant looks around.",
		"\"I'll keep an eye on him.\" The lieutenant cuts in faster than you can reply. \"Don't worry.\"",
		"The lieutenant sighs, and kneels to be eye-level with the girl. \"Maybe someone you know has acted a little different, lately?\"",
		"\"Press your damn cheek against Lamby, okay?\" The lieutenant sounds authoritative -- and surprisingly gruff.",
		"\"Where did you get these gloves?\"",
		"\"Kids.\" The lieutenant shakes his head.",
		"\"I think she means 'revolutionary'.\"",
		"\"We're going to need those gloves. It's for important police business.\" He enunciates the last two words carefully.",
		"\"Look,\" the lieutenant says impatiently. \"It's not something that can be explained on the go in couple of sentences. We have more important things to focus on right now, so let's get back to them, alright?\"",
		"The lieutenant cranes his head and mutters: \"GO HOME.\" He pauses. \"It's an *aerograffito*. It's meant for the Coalition aerostatics that keep a lookout on the city from the low troposphere.\"",
		"\"An aerostatic is an airship. A hybrid airship, semi-rigid.\" He points up to a small dot in the cloudline. \"*That* is an aerostatic.\"",
		"\"Well, at least you're not married.\" The lieutenant points at the ring on the man's left hand, the flesh around it swollen and grey.",
		"\"Seems like the head wound was fatal. It's exactly the shape of the bench...\"",
		"\"The next thing to do is call the station from my Kineema and hand over the case. Then we can return to the murder investigation and be done with it.\"",
		"\"Yes, yes,\" the lieutenant seems impatient, \"but what *actual* facts do you have that connect him with this woman you met at the bookstand?\"",
		"\"A *sequence killer*?\" The lieutenant narrows his eyes in the wind. \"There's nothing that connects those two bodies. This is a completely different case -- an accident.\"",
		"\"Alright. We've already examined the library card -- let's call the Jamrock Library from my Kineema, see if we can learn anything about this Billie Méjean.\"",
		"\"What about it? The deceased ate some kebab.\" He shrugs. \"It's probably from a nearby place, maybe in the Pox...\"",
		"\"Maybe, but we don't really have much time or resources to spare. The guys at Processing will take care of the rest.\"",
		"\"A field autopsy isn't necessary if the cause of death doesn't appear to be criminal -- and this looks like a simple accident to me.\"",
		"\"Oh yes,\" the lieutenant nods.",
		"\"The woman you met at the bookstand?\" He looks at the bundle of flesh and rags lying on the ground. \"Why do you think it's her husband?\"",
		"\"Death by misadventure. He slipped and fell through the boardwalk. A truly unfortunate accident... If it wouldn't have been for that bench, he'd be alive.\"",
		"\"Alright. The station is going to want details, however. Let's examine that library card you found on the man's body, see if it has any clues. Then we can call the station from my Kineema and hand over the case.\"",
		"\"Looks like he's been dead for a while. I'm surprised no one found him before you came along.\" He stands up and shivers as a gust of wind blows through his bomber jacket.",
		"\"But you're right, let's not run ahead. For now all we know is that he's an unidentified middle-aged man found dead on the Martinaise boardwalk.\"",
		"\"Alright. The station is going to want details, however. We already examined the library card we found on the body -- good, that should be enough for the first lead.\"",
		"\"Looks like he's been dead for a while. I'm surprised no one found him before you came along.\" He stands up and shivers as a gust of wind blows through his bomber jacket.",
		"\"Lividity is faintly pronounced. Whoever this is, he's been dead for two days, no longer.\" He stands up and shivers as a gust of wind blows through his bomber jacket. \"We need to investigate.\"",
		"\"Looks like one of the locals -- he'd have to know this spot to come here. You don't *just* walk over here.\" He looks south, the way you came.",
		"\"I don't see any other major wounds. Do you?\"",
		"\"I'd prefer if you didn't collect them this time. It's not... proper.\"",
		"\"No, I don't see anything that points in that direction. For now let's treat this case as a simple -- albeit sad -- accident, unrelated to the murder case.\"",
		"\"But let's try to not run ahead -- for now all we know is that he's an unidentified middle-aged man found dead on the Martinaise boardwalk.\"",
		"\"They'll seal this place off after the news reaches the Coalition officials. I doubt that they have enough resources to actually repair the boardwalk.\"",
		"\"Without any further evidence -- yes.\"",
		"\"Good call. The guys at Processing can take care of the rest.\"",
		"\"Alright. We should first examine that library card you found. Then we can call the station from my Kineema, let them know we're taking the case.\"",
		"\"Hold on...\" The lieutenant leans over the corpse and examines his face. Two glassy eyes stare back at him, void of any signs of life.",
		"\"We should take another look at the library card you found on him,\" the lieutenant says, straightening his back.",
		"\"Well, he's definitely *someone's* husband.\" The lieutenant points at the golden ring on the man's left hand, the flesh around it swollen and pale.",
		"\"And he was married.\" The lieutenant points at the ring on the man's left hand, the flesh around it swollen and grey.",
		"\"It does seem to be a pretty straightforward misadventure, although there's still the question of identifying the body...\"",
		"\"But I think that death arrived through head trauma, not liver failure.\"",
		"\"Damn it... He's definitely *someone's* husband.\" The lieutenant points at the golden ring on the man's left hand, the flesh around it swollen and pale.",
		"\"I'd say we should just write down 'head trauma' and leave it at that. Let's keep this detour as short as possible -- the sooner we get back to finding Ruby the better.\"",
		"\"And while we're there we should also call the station, let them know that we're taking the case.\"",
		"\"The bright blue lining?\" He nods, then points at the ring on the man's left hand: \"Well, he's definitely *someone's* husband.\"",
		"\"Hold on...\" The lieutenant squats next to the corpse and examines his face. Two bulging eyes stare back at him, void of any signs of life.",
		"\"No need to rush.\"",
		"\"I'd say we should just write down 'head trauma' in the autopsy report and leave it at that. It would save us at least two hours of unnecessary work.\"",
		"\"Tare, all around us...\" He looks at two other bottles forgotten near the coin-operated viewer.",
		"\"Tare, all around us...\" He looks at two other bottles near the coin-operated viewer, then at your yellow plastic bag.",
		"\"From where I stand I can see two options. We either take the case and follow the leads to identify the body on our own -- or we report back to the station and leave this for our colleagues to handle.\"",
		"\"Yes, but... I just wanted to make it clear it's not a sequence killer, okay?\"",
		"\"It's possible, but let's take it step-by-step. We still haven't identified the man.\"",
		"The lieutenant shudders from the cold. \"I've seen it before: almost the same scenario. Even the chewing gum. It's always the same...\"",
		"\"Good, we should take a look at that library card after this is done.\"",
		"\"I can't see a book...\" The lieutenant pats his pockets. \"So he took the book to the library, then came back and thought -- I'll have one.\"",
		"\"Not that sealing it off would keep anyone away. All it does is keep the city council's hands clean.\" He smiles sourly.",
		"\"Some symptoms of acute alcohol poisoning could have definitely played a role here: severe confusion, respiratory depression, unpredictable behaviour...\"",
		"\"He ate the whole pack, right? It's to cover the smell of alcohol before going home. The worst thing is...\"",
		"\"But that's just a lazy assumption. What do you think?\"",
		"\"We do know that he was married.\" The lieutenant points at the ring on the man's left hand, the flesh around it swollen and grey.",
		"\"The wedding ring.\" The lieutenant points at the ring on the man's left hand, the flesh around it swollen and grey.",
		"\"Well...\" The lieutenant looks at you, then the bottles. \"Yes. I think we can say with relative confidence that it was you.\"",
		"\"I am. But it doesn't matter right now. Let's just move on.\"",
		"\"Yes,\" the lieutenant marks dryly. \"This looks pretty advanced alright. For now, let's just move on.\"",
		"\"It really *really* doesn't.\" The lieutenant turns to go. \"Let's turn our attention elsewhere and move on.\"",
		"\"Yes,\" the lieutenant agrees. \"This scene isn't exactly ripping with joy. Let's just move on.\" He turns to leave.",
		"You glance over at the lieutenant, who is standing, as usual, with his hands neatly folded behind his back. What he's thinking about, if he's thinking about anything at all, is absolutely opaque to you.",
		"\"What's the matter, detective?\" The lieutenant turns to you with a start.",
		"\"Then perhaps you should stop reading it.\"",
		"\"Ah, yes. The problem with mass market paperbacks... They're not made to last...\"",
		"\"Perhaps this is a sign that you should get back to solving your own murder, eh, detective?\"",
		"\"That's probably for the best. Those books aren't exactly famed for their tight plotting.\"",
		"\"Too bad, detective. If it's any consolation, the resolution is almost never very satisfying...\"",
		"\"Are you really reading that, detective?\"",
		"\"Good luck finding it. He's not much of a character, I think you'll find. Just a stand-in for the reader.\"",
		"The lieutenant gives you a quizzical expression in return. You go back to the story...",
		"The lieutenant shrugs, resigned to the idea that his profession will rarely, if ever, be accurately represented in art and literature.",
		"\"And on that note, perhaps we should get back to making sense of our own case?\"",
		"\"Well, you won't find it in *there*. Those books are much more about ravishing dames and gun play than real policework.\"",
		"\"What's the matter, detective?\"",
		"\"That's a market. It's worth *two victory points*.\"",
		"\"Don't worry, it was mostly just luck. You'll earn some points soon enough.\"",
		"The lieutenant sighs. \"That's the problem with certain games. At some point they just *end*, as though no one expected the players to make it that far...\"",
		"The lieutenant shrugs. \"There are some *paranoid* types who believe the Moralintern keeps detailed score sheets for everyone in the Reál Belt, but that's obviously nonsense...\"",
		"\"Otherwise, no. There are no points, just your actions and the consequences of those actions.\"",
		"\"Holy shit, the average playing time for this game is one to *six* hours...\"",
		"The lieutenant looks up from his tabulations. \"I've got 20 points,\" he says with measured pride...",
		"\"More or less,\" the lieutenant says, but he's thinking less about matters of historical wrongdoing than how to get out of the jam you've put him in...",
		"\"Now, I believe it's your turn...\"",
		"\"A risky gambit, detective. Sorry it didn't pay off.\"",
		"The lieutenant opens his mouth as if to issue a blistering retort, then hesitates...",
		"The lieutenant nods gravely as you erect tariffs against his apricots and sugar. This is going to get ugly...",
		"\"You know, detective, there's... something *admirable* about that, in its own way...\"",
		"\"You should probably pick one strategy and stick to it. Trying to do a little of everything is usually a bad idea.\"",
		"\"Don't be glum, detective. There's always next time. Figuratively, I mean. There's no way we have time to play this game again...\"",
		"Now it's the lieutenant's turn to respond. He moves aggressively onto the Safre territory. Soon his workers are producing a steady supply of extremely valuable *apricots*...",
		"\"Yes, precisely.\"",
		"The lieutenant looks up from his tabulations. \"I've got 15 points,\" he says with a slight smirk on his face...",
		"\"Hey, at least you went out playing the game how you wanted. There's something to be said for that.\"",
		"\"See? I warned you investing in your workers wasn't going to pay off.\"",
		"\"You can't do that, detective,\" the lieutenant says as you move all of your pieces onto one of his territories.",
		"\"You see in Table 8c that investing in territorial infrastructure multiplies your final victory point total by 1x, which is to say, not at all, whereas erecting monuments in Revachol gives you a multiplier of *5x*...\"",
		"\"As I recall, it was your turn, detective.\"",
		"The lieutenant looks up from his tabulations. \"I've got 20 points,\" he says, slightly embarrassed at the point differential...",
		"\"That's up to you, detective. But remember, the objective of the game is to earn victory points for the suzerain...\"",
		"\"No, not at all. I suspect this is going to be a rather *low-scoring* game...\"",
		"\"I'm not going to play with you if you're going to act like a child. Now come on, take your turn.\"",
		"\"That's a subject for another time. All you need to know is that they're a powerful transnational organization, of which the *Coalition* and by extension the RCM are but one small piece.\"",
		"\"You know, detective, there's... something *admirable* about that, in its own way...\"",
		"\"That might have been a good idea, yes...\"",
		"\"I'm not sure we can afford to set aside *that* kind of time for a *game*.\"",
		"The lieutenant scoffs. \"In your *dreams*, maybe. I've thrashed my share of trash-talkers before. Now come on, let's put childish things aside.\"",
		"\"Hmmm... this doesn't look right to me. I think we need to start over, unfortunately...\"",
		"In response, the lieutenant spends two of his sugar and one of his apricot tokens to complete his contract card. He is rewarded with four coins and a round wooden token that he places in the centre of the board...",
		"\"You do realize the game is called *Suzerainty* and not *Workers' Paradise*, right?\"",
		"\"I hope you learned your lesson,\" the lieutenant says with a sharp smile.",
		"The lieutenant gives you a sour look. He may or may not hate fun, but either way he does not appreciate your attitude...",
		"Despite your trash-talking, the lieutenant still has a formidable store of coins and resources...",
		"Despite your conspicuous display of wealth, the lieutenant still has a formidable store of coins and resources...",
		"\"Hmmm, too bad investing in your workers just isn't worth many points.\"",
		"\"Let's tally up the scores, shall we?\"",
		"\"Now, let's tally up the scores, shall we?\"",
		"\"Now, let's tally up the scores, shall we?\"",
		"\"Now, let's clean up and get back to work.\"",
		"The lieutenant goes first. He draws a contract card and moves several of his workers to the Safre territory of the board and the others to the Semenine Islands...",
		"\"I have no idea what 'lesson' you think you taught me. Somehow I don't think this is going to work out well for *either* of us...\"",
		"\"Alright, detective. Your turn.\"",
		"The lieutenant looks up from his tabulations. \"I've got 15 points,\" he says...",
		"As he completes his own contract card, the lieutenant is rewarded with four coins and a round wooden token that he places in the centre of the board...",
		"\"Oh, those are nice.\" The lieutenant picks up a sugar token and admires it.",
		"\"Now, let's tally up the scores, shall we?\"",
		"\"Well, I suppose you could try fulfilling some contracts, or you might try to relocate your workers. There are any number of strategies open to you.\"",
		"\"That's just the way it is.\" The lieutenant doesn't seem to find much value in dwelling on the subject...",
		"The lieutenant nods. \"Now, I believe it's your turn...\"",
		"\"Are you sure?\" The lieutenant looks a little disappointed. \"It's going to take a while to set everything up again.\"",
		"\"Well, there's always next time. Figuratively, I mean. There's no way we have time to play this game again...\"",
		"\"Alright, you've convinced me. How do we play?\"",
		"\"This is a game of *economic* strategy. You can't directly attack the other players. You'll have to do something else.\"",
		"\"Now we find out what's left of our economies...\"",
		"\"Don't be a sore loser, detective. Your moves were your own...\"",
		"The lieutenant looks over the rulebook before he sees something that makes his eyes go wide...",
		"\"They're nice tokens, yes. Very impressive...\"",
		"The lieutenant continues his strategy of aggressively producing apricots for export. He fulfils contract after contract, racking up ever more victory points...",
		"\"Game designers, I imagine.\"",
		"\"An aggressive opening, detective,\" the lieutenant says, appearing to relish the challenge.",
		"\"That might have helped, yes...\"",
		"\"As I recall, it was your turn, detective.\"",
		"The lieutenant looks up from his tabulations. \"I've got 26 points,\" he says, a barely contained smile breaking out across his face...",
		"\"Now, let's tally up the scores, shall we?\"",
		"\"What, you're not going to offer to let *me* punch any of them out?\"",
		"\"The workers are just there to produce raw resources. You're not supposed to worry about them too much.\"",
		"\"Because the way you earn points is by pleasing the suzerain, and the player with the most points wins the game.\"",
		"\"I don't think the suzerain *cares* much about the welfare of its workers. Here, watch this...\"",
		"\"Hmmm, I do feel like my thinking has become somewhat *rigid*. Maybe a little diversion to keep the mind limber is just what's in order...\"",
		"\"I see you bring the same *unorthodox technique* to playing board games as you do to detective work...\"",
		"\"A little late for that, I think...\"",
		"The lieutenant sighs so hard for a moment it seems like he may asphyxiate...",
		"\"Points are nothing. They don't exist. They're just an arbitrary convention that games use to reward or punish players for certain behaviours.\"",
		"\"Not bad, detective.\"",
		"The lieutenant looks up from his tabulations. \"I've got 26 points,\" he says, slightly disappointed...",
		"\"When I thrash you I want to make sure it's *by the book*.\"",
		"\"Hrm...\" The lieutenant's face goes stony as you take your turn. He does not appreciate you getting all his workers addicted to cocaine...",
		"Realising victory is slipping away, the lieutenant launches a desperate gambit: *Protectionism*. By erecting tariffs on your cocaine he hopes to starve you out of the market at the risk of incurring the suzerain's disfavour...",
		"\"C'mon, detective. This is the endgame! Let's just finish up quickly.\"",
		"The lieutenant opens his mouth as if to issue a blistering retort, then hesitates...",
		"\"Never fuck with Kim Kitsuragi.\"",
		"\"A tie,\" he says, with evident irritation. \"Well, I suppose that's what we deserve for trashing the suzerain's economy. Good game, detective.\"",
		"\"Ouch,\" the lieutenant says, cringing at your spectacular failure.",
		"\"Come on, detective, you knew the rules of the game going in...\"",
		"Meanwhile, the lieutenant spends two of his sugar and one of his apricot tokens to complete his contract card. He is rewarded with four coins and a round wooden token that he places in the centre of the board...",
		"Soon the entire board is a field of economic carnage. Worker tokens lie strewn across the board, which is also bereft of valuable resources.",
		"\"Are you sure?\" The lieutenant looks a little disappointed. \"It's going to take a while to set everything up again.\"",
		"\"Well, *winning* is usually the point of playing games. Here, watch this...\"",
		"\"Take a look at the scoring tables in the back...\" The lieutenant turns to one of those appendices you skipped over earlier...",
		"\"Looks like you won convincingly... well played, detective.\"",
		"\"Alright, detective, you win. How do we play this game?\"",
		"\"Well played, detective. That museum is worth three victory points...\"",
		"\"Yes, you're *really* sticking it to the game designers, just like I'm about to stick it to *you*...\"",
		"\"Now, let's tally up the scores, shall we?\"",
		"While you daydream about speed, the lieutenant has built himself a formidable economic engine of his own...",
		"The lieutenant returns your baleful look with a satisfied grin.",
		"\"Noble as that sentiment may be, it's not exactly a *winning* strategy in a game that revolves around resource extraction and exploitation...\"",
		"\"Come on, detective, don't be a spoil sport. You'll have plenty of chances to earn your own points.\"",
		"\"Don't look too glum, detective. There's always next time. Figuratively, I mean. There's no way we have time to play this game again...\"",
		"\"I'm happy for you,\" he answers.",
		"\"Bullet holes generally look the same, so... probably.\" He leans in to inspect the wall. \"But you are right, more old bullet holes from the Revolution.\"",
		"\"Might be the after-effects of your... past escapades. What are you looking at?\"",
		"\"No, we're not constructors and renovators. And these bullet holes do not warrant an investigation.\"",
		"The lieutenant nods.",
		"\"You were looking pale there for a second. What are you looking at?\"",
		"\"Not much. I don't have a *fresh perspective* on it. Should we go?\"",
		"\"You okay there?\" The lieutenant's sudden voice cuts like a blade, bringing you out of the stupor.",
		"\"Plenty.\"",
		"\"Perhaps *a* crime of a sort, ages ago... but no, these do not warrant an investigation.\"",
		"The lieutenant inspects the wall, then nods. \"Another set of old bullet holes from the Revolution.\"",
		"The lieutenant looks at the wall. \"Remnants from the Revolution. These are over half a century old.\"",
		"\"A history of violence streaking all across Revachol.\"",
		"\"Dweorgr, huh?\" The lieutenant shrugs. \"I was always more of a sidhe or huldur guy myself.\"",
		"The lieutenant says nothing, but his face is rigid. It seems he does not approve of your athletic displays.",
		"\"Yes, officer...\" The lieutenant gives you a quick side-glance. \"What *do* we need from these gentlemen?\"",
		"The lieutenant is looking at you. His face is expressionless.",
		"\"Unlike men, they also have to deal with the very same mentality you two are displaying right now.\" He frowns. \"If it weren't for *this* they would outperform us.\"",
		"\"The RCM doesn't discriminate,\" the lieutenant marks dryly. \"Women are held to the same standards as men. And -- as reflected in the quarterly statistics -- are equally effective in their jobs.\"",
		"\"Of course not.\" He doesn't even look up from his notebook.",
		"The lieutenant sighs audibly, but keeps his eyes on the notebook.",
		"\"You already threw their ball into the water, took a sandwich from one of them, and a medal from the other. What more could we possibly want? Perhaps we're done bullying these citizens?\"",
		"\"I don't think there was anything else he wanted. Was there? You got the medal, now let's solve the crime.\"",
		"\"You already threw their ball into the water and took his medal, perhaps we're done bullying these citizens?\"",
		"The lieutenant looks up from his notes and nods to the old carabineer.",
		"\"I don't like where this is going, officer. Don't you think we should do something else now?\"",
		"He sighs. \"Hurry up then.\"",
		"\"We should leave quickly before it happens again.\" He looks around. \"Right now is a good moment.\"",
		"\"What was that all about? Some experimental interrogation technique you're honing?\"",
		"\"I'm relieved to hear that.\" He peers at you over his glasses. \"Are you well enough to move on to something else now?\"",
		"\"I know a *Weird Cop* when I see one.\" The lieutenant adjusts his glasses. \"It doesn't work. *Weird Cop* only confuses the suspect and the *Weird Cop* himself, while all he should have done was ask normal questions.\"",
		"\"Let's try not to get caught in the...\" The lieutenant lowers his voice: \"Crossfire.\"",
		"\"I'm actually already a member in a group tasked to keep the streets safe,\" the lieutenant marks. \"You are too. We call ourselves *The Police*.\"",
		"\"What the hell are you talking about? What *foreign anarchist*?\" the lieutenant asks, confused.",
		"\"Are you sure?\" The lieutenant raises his eyebrows. \"Cause right now it looks like you're organizing a vigilante group.\"",
		"\"What?\" The lieutenant gives you a sharp glance. \"What *oppressors*?\"",
		"\"Uh... okay...\" The lieutenant looks worried. \"I *might* understand if you told me, but, sure... let's not waste any more time here.\" He turns to leave.",
		"The lieutenant's eyes inspect your face for a while, then his posture relaxes. \"Okay, let's go.\"",
		"\"No.\" The lieutenant almost rolls his eyes. \"You're not. We can just leave...\"",
		"\"You don't need to. He doesn't know anything.\"",
		"\"You put him up to this yourself -- when you decided to talk to him in the first place.\"",
		"\"No.\"",
		"\"Please don't waste time on nonsense.\"",
		"\"Hmh...\" the lieutenant mumbles optimistically. \"Alcohol use *has* been declining in the under 16 bracket this past decade...\"",
		"\"But... but... *why*?\" He looks truly puzzled. \"You're turning this into a huge thing.\"",
		"\"No -- what we *need* is to get back to work. He doesn't know anything.\"",
		"The lieutenant doesn't even shrug.",
		"\"You are, officer,\" says the lieutenant, breaking his silence. \"Get yourself together.\"",
		"\"Now how about we go and do something worth the public's time?\"",
		"\"Officer, *you* need to calm down,\" says the lieutenant, breaking his silence. \"Get a hold of yourself.\"",
		"\"No, officer -- you did this,\" says the lieutenant, breaking his silence. \"Get yourself together.\"",
		"The lieutenant isn't laughing. At all.",
		"\"No, you don't.\" He stops you. \"No one is *checking out* anything. Put that away.\"",
		"\"No, you really, really don't. That is a twelve year old boy. His opinion of you doesn't matter.\"",
		"\"Officer, this is very far from normal police conduct,\" says the lieutenant, breaking his silence. \"Get yourself together.\"",
		"With a quick motion the lieutenant stops your hand before your palm opens. \"Are you crazy?\"",
		"\"You lost control,\" says the lieutenant, breaking his silence. \"You need to get yourself together.\"",
		"\"Put it away.\" The lieutenant crosses his arms. \"The information here isn't worth it.\"",
		"\"I told you not to tempt such forces.\" The annoyance in his voice is directed at you, not the gremlins.",
		"\"Yeah, laugh it up. Let's just get back to it.\" (Get up.)",
		"\"Officer, you need to get up. This is turning into a farce.\"",
		"\"What are you doing?\" The lieutenant's dark eyes peer into yours over his spectacles.",
		"\"Uh... okay...\" The lieutenant looks worried. \"If you absolutely *need* to.\" He shakes his head. \"But right now let's move out.\"",
		"\"You're totally unraveling, officer.\"",
		"\"Put that away. Right now.\" He stops you.",
		"\"If I were to want to waste my time -- which I do not -- I would ask them who he is, how he got there, and the *usual*.\"",
		"\"Hmmm... maybe we should.\" The lieutenant raises an eyebrow.",
		"\"Uhm...\" The lieutenant's eyes flash behind his glasses. \"It's not *that* dramatic. We can just send the body to Processing...\"",
		"\"Why don't we go pester some other kids now?\" he says impatiently.",
		"\"He means the bookstore -- we have to ask the proprietor of the bookstore.\"",
		"\"He means the bookstore -- we have to ask...\" He checks his notes. \"*Plaisance* is the mother of the little girl peddling books on the plaza. We have to ask Plaisance, in the store.\"",
		"The lieutenant remains silent, but his expression couldn't say *I told you so* any louder.",
		"The lieutenant takes a quick note in his notebook.",
		"\"Huh...\" The lieutenant has his nose in his notebook. \"I have no idea what you just said.\"",
		"You can't help but notice a little approving nod the lieutenant makes. He agrees.",
		"The lieutenant turns to see where you are pointing. He looks interested.",
		"\"Thank you for your advice, Eugene. And you too, Alain. I do always appreciate a good use of the expression 'milkers'.\"",
		"\"Take it easy on the drink. The danger has not passed -- this town needs you on your feet.\"",
		"The lieutenant shakes his head but doesn't say anything.",
		"The lieutenant sighs.",
		"\"Was this really the best idea?\" The lieutenant pauses to think for a moment. \"I guess you may have prolonged his existence a bit. If he can still remember this when he sobers up.\"",
		"\"This is a broken man,\" he whispers to you. \"He probably feels that he should have been able to protect the others somehow. And now he feels guilty for not dying with them, or instead of them.\"",
		"\"Our condolences for your losses,\" he says with a little nod, but the remaining Hardie boys don't seem to register his words.",
		"\"And do you have any information on this 'songbird of misery'?\"",
		"\"I'm not suggesting much. All I'm saying is -- he lost everything.\"",
		"\"That's kind of you to say.\" The lieutenant closes his notes. \"Take care of your friend, okay?\"",
		"\"I think even in this *fictional* reality, the 57th would still be *my* station.\" The lieutenant makes a little nod towards the man with sunglasses.",
		"\"He's wounded.\" He looks at you. \"It's been a long week -- and he's handled an actual corpse.\"",
		"\"There weren't any cameras around.\" He stares at his boots. \"They don't have cameras...\"",
		"\"He is -- he's getting better. And I can confirm that he drank a *lot* of alcohol prior to it happening.\"",
		"\"He *did* present this theory to me -- once before. I had trouble believing it then, but he seems to be convinced. And I've seen him work. His methods are... unorthodox.\"",
		"\"We might need your help with something later,\" he adds, suddenly regaining his confidence.",
		"\"*Crab-man* is an unfortunate choice of words -- but I was there. The church on the coast shook from an audio-spatial anomaly. It may have been entroponetic, or perhaps related to radio waves...\"",
		"They're your posse. Or what remains of it. Hand-picked. Hand-lost.",
		"\"Either way, it was real. I've even put it in my report -- you should read it. I do not, however, think it has anything to do with him drinking himself to the point of brain damage.\"",
		"\"That is what I thought -- at first. That it was a fantasy. But... I've seen him work. It's not. He really is experiencing something out of the ordinary. He really does not remember.\"",
		"\"He's wounded.\" He looks at you. \"It's been a long week.\"",
		"\"Either way, I have put this into my report -- you should read it. I do not, however, think it has anything to do with him drinking himself to the point of brain damage.\"",
		"\"He *has* hinted at the possibility before. I have trouble believing him, of course, but he seems to want to convince himself of it. And I've seen him work. His methods are... unorthodox.\"",
		"\"The 41st isn't...\" He trails off, not wishing to finish the sentence.",
		"\"Lieutenant Kim Kitsuragi, Precinct 57. We've just come from the island...\" He points to the seafort. \"Where our investigation led us.\"",
		"\"But this is clearly a *departmental matter*, so I'm  going to leave you to discuss it among yourselves.\"",
		"\"Yes. I'm still Kim Kitsuragi -- still a lieutenant from Precinct 57.\"",
		"\"This sounds odd -- but I was there. The church on the coast was shaking from an audio-spatial anomaly. It may have been entroponetic, or perhaps related to radio waves...\"",
		"\"In the crowd, there was a man and a woman in RCM uniform,\" he says to you, then turns to Vicquemare. \"In his defence -- we were in a hurry.\"",
		"As you approach the door leading out of the hostel, the bespectacled man in an orange bomber jacket turns to you:",
		"As you approach the door leading out of the hostel, the bespectacled man in an orange bomber jacket turns to you:",
		"\"Excuse me... I think you may be the person I've been waiting for.\" He narrows his eyes and extends his hand in greeting.",
		"\"This would have been *very* helpful with the 'Megamix'.\" He stares at the tape player. \"But it isn't anymore.\"",
		"The lieutenant doesn't even flinch. \"Anyway, let's try to find a new tape player. Perhaps we should talk to Roy at the pawnshop.\"",
		"\"Of course,\" he notes. \"Anyway, we should try to find a new tape player. There's a pawnshop near the water lock, south of here. Maybe they have a spare.\"",
		"The lieutenant doesn't even flinch. \"Anyway, let's try to find a new tape player. There's a pawnshop near the water lock, maybe they have a spare.\"",
		"\"My Kineema only comes with a radio,\" he ponders. \"Let's try to find a new tape player. Perhaps we should talk to Roy at the pawnshop -- he has stuff.\"",
		"\"My Kineema only comes with a radio,\" he ponders. \"We should try to find a new tape player. There's a pawnshop near the water lock, south of here. Maybe they have a spare.\"",

		"The lieutenant looks at you as you remove the tape from the boombox. He doesn't say anything.",
		"The lieutenant watches you pack up the boombox. He doesn't say anything.",
		"\"Good. I also know the alphabet.\"",
		"\"I'll pass,\" the lieutenant replies with a polite nod. \"Thanks.\"",
		"He shrugs. \"I mean I'm not hungry and therefore am not gonna take it. Thanks though.\"",
		"\"Stop that!\" He doesn't sound amused.",
		"\"No, it's... it's okay. Let's share it, okay?\" The lieutenant breaks the sandwich in two and quickly eats his half.",
		"\"Camaraderie?\"",
		"\"Okay-okay. They are all necessary. Let's share the sandwich, if it matters that much to you.\" The lieutenant breaks the sandwich in two and quickly eats his half.",
		"The lieutenant's eyes express an absolute lack of interest.",
		"\"Officer. We have serious matters to attend to. I suggest we get to them right now.\" He seems completely unfazed by the situation.",
		"The lieutenant slaps the sandwich out of your hand faster than you could ever hope to react in your sorry state. It lands in the dirt and falls apart.",
		"The lieutenant nods.",
		"The lieutenant stands next to you, but he might as well exist in a parallel realm.",
		"The lieutenant nods and adds, \"But you go right ahead.\"",
		"\"Then sure. Let us 'strengthen our bond'.\" The lieutenant breaks the sandwich in two and quickly eats his half.",
		"\"Is it really necessary?\"",
		"\"No.\"",
		"\"Good.\" The lieutenant nods. \"Very nourishing. Let's go solve crimes now.\"",
		"\"Thank you, but no, I'm not hungry.\"",
		"One look at the lieutenant immediately tells you he is ready for your Assault-Sandwich.",
		"\"Great.\" The lieutenant shakes his head. \"Wonderful. Good job. I mean why *wouldn't* you throw it... wait, turns out I don't actually care. Leave it and let's go.\"",
		"\"Sure, sure.\" The lieutenant nods impatiently. \"Time to go solve a murder investigation.\"",
		"\"Go through all that and then just dump it?\" The lieutenant smirks. \"You better just eat it, no need for dramatic gestures.\"",
		"\"No.\"",
		"\"...some people would feel compelled to take it. Yes, I know.\"",
		"\"No.\"",
		"\"I'm just not hungry.\"",
		"He opens his notes. \"She said it would be for *Annouk Meijer-Smit*. Annouk -- Meijer -- Smit.\"",
		"\"No. She lied to us. Her so-called real name was not her real name. Somehow she's managed to lie to us about that too...\" He almost smiles.",
		"\"Like a magpie?\" He looks around. \"What a coincidence. Then it would also have *collected* the other objects, which would be highly unusual...\"",
		"\"I don't know who Katarzine Alasije is, but it's safe to say it's not her either. In short: we got lied to, again. In a way she's *still* lying to us...\" The lieutenant can't help but smile.",
		"\"Klaasje's hidden documents...\" The lieutenant looks at it in your hands. \"From the empty buoy.\"",
		"\"Yes, somehow she managed to lie to us -- *one more time*. In a way she's still lying to us right now.\" The lieutenant smiles.",
		"\"I don't know who Katarzine Alasije is, but it's safe to say it's not her either. In short: we got lied to, again. Good luck to whoever is questioning her in the 57th right now.\"",
		"\"Like a magpie?\" He looks around. \"What a coincidence. Then it would also have *collected* the other objects, which would be highly unusual...\"",
		"\"I don't know. But it's not Katarzine Alasije. Or Klaasje. Or Annouk Meijer-Smit. We didn't even scratch the surface with her, detective.\"",
		"\"Klaasje's hidden documents...\" The lieutenant looks at it in your hands. \"That she said would be in a buoy on the coast.\"",
		"\"An octopus belongs to a very different Class. It's not even an insect, it's a mollusc. But, yes -- I see your point.\"",
		"\"Phasmids are not capable of holding grudges. Only humans and some tracking predators do that.\"",
		"\"Perhaps... But that still doesn't explain how it got into the nest.\"",
		"\"I don't know. But it was not Katarzine Alasije. Or Annouk Meijer-Smit. Or Klaasje. Whoever she is -- when we get back I need to warn our holding cells. We need to double the security around her.\"",
		"\"I can see how the helmet could wash up on the island. And the scope -- maybe Mr. Dros lost it? But to seek this out would be *very* unusual behaviour for an arthropod.\"",
		"\"Maybe our man, Mr. Dros, took it from Klaasje's -- or whatever her name was -- hiding place? Or...\"",
		"He looks east. \"Perhaps it's better that we didn't arrest her. Who knows what hell she'd be raising in my district by now...\"",
		"He thinks about it for a moment, then gingerly picks up a slice and starts chewing on it thoughtfully.",
		"\"I thought it was the symbolism that was important, not the type of...\" He takes off his glasses and rubs his forehead. \"Please, just... enjoy the pie.\"",
		"The lieutenant crosses his arms. \"Food of my choice, on my own schedule.\"",
		"\"I just don't want any. Please, enjoy, and then let's move on.\"",
		"\"That depends on one's perspective.\" He takes off his glasses and rubs his forehead. \"Please, just... enjoy the pie.\"",
		"\"That's a ridiculous notion. We are not living in a highly ritualistic society where not sharing food with someone indicates animosity. We are in Revachol, where people ought to be free not to eat topping pie when they are not hungry.\"",
		"He inclines his head. \"Why...?\" he starts, then thinks better of it.",
		"He sighs. \"Don't take it personally.\"",
		"He sighs. \"Haven't I already proven that we are comrades or whatever by splitting that sandwich with you?\"",
		"\"Well, then: no, thank you.\"",
		"The lieutenant takes the pie from you and calmly lets it fall to the ground, face down. \"All done. Shall we?\"",
		"The lieutenant looks at you wearily. \"Please let's not go through this again.\"",
		"\"No, thank you.\"",
		"He finishes his slice and brushes the wheat-free flour off his hands. \"That wasn't terrible. Well, shall we?\"",
		"\"Of course.\" He nods, then looks longingly toward the exit.",
		"\"I have no idea what that means.\" He looks toward the exit, longingly.",
		"\"I can see that.\" He takes a step toward the door. It looks like he'd like to leave now. The atmosphere is oppressive.",
		"\"It's not as bad as I thought. There are no elephant corpses. Should we go maybe?\"",
		"\"Wonderful,\" he nods, then looks toward the exit, longingly.",
		"He takes a step toward the door. Like he'd like to leave.",
		"\"I can see that. The potted plant under the table is a Seraise Fern. They have those in South Safre too. All things considered...\" He looks around, as if to check.",
		"\"And by that you mean crimes against humanity?\"",
		"\"I know what you meant.\" He looks toward the exit, longingly.",
		"\"I have no idea what that means.\" He looks toward the exit, longingly.",
		"\"No problem, officer.\" He takes a step toward the door. Like he'd like to leave.",
		"\"I can see that.\" He takes a step toward the door. \"You're the RCM's own Soldier of the Apocalypse, aren't you?\"",
		"He nods.",
		"\"Yes. Well. I was able to re-contextualize it as a *dark joke*.\" He pauses thoughtfully. \"I will not be able to re-contextualize it the next time.\"",
		"\"The Gloaming?\" He takes off his glasses and cleans them. \"Now, that's exactly what we *can't* have. Couldn't have put it better myself. I would need to *re-contextualize* the hell out of that.\"",
		"He puts his glasses back on and repeats: \"Never. Now, let's go.\"",
		"\"Good. I'm glad we had this talk.\" He nods. \"After you.\"",
		"\"Whooh...\" He takes off his glasses, reaches for a cloth -- pauses -- and puts his glasses back on.",
		"\"I don't know why she left you. Let's go.\"",
		"\"We can't have RCM officers going around, putting guns in their mouths. We can't afford to have that image. Few institutions can.\"",
		"\"No, no. We are talking about it. I was able to re-contextualize it as a dark joke.\" He pauses thoughtfully. \"I will not be able to re-contextualize it the next time.\"",
		"\"Yes. Well. I was able to re-contextualize it as a dark joke.\" He pauses thoughtfully. \"I will not be able to re-contextualize it the next time.\"",
		"\"No.\" He takes off his glasses and cleans them. \"You're not. You're not going to put your gun into your mouth when we interrogate people. That is never going to happen again.\"",
		"\"I understand you sometimes employ *extreme* interrogation tactics, but I want you to understand: that was *too* extreme.\"",
		"He puts his glasses back on. \"Now, let's go. And let's keep guns out of our mouths. And not say anything about any gloaming, or anything like that.\"",
		"\"The theatrical suicide attempt -- we need to talk about it.\"",
		"\"No need to apologize -- just keep your gun out of your mouth and we'll be all right.\" He nods. \"Let's move.\"",
		"\"We do. I was able to re-contextualize it as a dark joke.\" He pauses thoughtfully. \"I will not be able to re-contextualize it the next time.\"",
		"\"Yes. Very, very, *very* wrong.\" He nods in agreement. \"I'm glad you see it my way. Let's go.\"",
		"He nods. \"Let's get going. We have a case to solve.\"",
		"\"Okay. Well. I'm not going to ask who Van Eyck is. I'm just going to assume it's your business and move on, okay?\" He raises his collar.",
		"The lieutenant is looking at the spot you were reaching for. \"Did you notice something important?\"",
		"\"Officer? Are you okay in there?\"",
		"\"What do you mean 'who's there'? It's me, Kim. Stop playing around and help me get this door open.\"",
		"\"After you *climbed* up to the roof, you mean? There's a maintenance entrance under the boardwalk. It's next to a drain pipe, possibly a storm drain -- it was easy to miss before.\"",
		"\"Yes, we have an exit. So, let's get going. Time to investigate these passages...\" He peers into the darkness.",
		"\"Yes. Time to investigate these passages. Let's move quietly and not make more sound.\"",
		"\"Yes, yes, it's *cool* to risk your life climbing rickety ladders. Anyway, let's investigate these passages...\"",
		"\"Huh, I hope no one *dangerous* heard that.\"",
		"He shrugs. \"At least now we have an exit. So, let's get going. It's time to investigate these passages...\"",
		"\"All right.\" The lieutenant looks across the canal. \"We can go to the coast now. Expect rugged terrain -- and drunks.\"",
		"\"Looks like it, yes. We should probably go tell Lena. Take a load off her mind.\"",
		"\"Okay...\" The lieutenant looks across the canal. \"If we ever need to get to the coast, then this is the way. But please, contain your *wanderlust* for now. I don't want us to get sidetracked. Not with everything that's going on.\"",
		"\"Mm-hmm.\" The lieutenant hums to himself while staring at your activities.",
		"\"Yes, it would have been *very* cool.\" The lieutenant nods. \"Now let's get some rest.\"",
		"\"Good. It's already late, we need to get some rest. Tomorrow will be another tough day.\"",
		"\"Good. It's late, we should get some rest.\"",
		"\"...a foolish hope. But it's okay. I get it. It would have been *cool*.\" The lieutenant nods. \"Now let's get some rest.\"",
		"\"We've been running around together doing *odd things* for days. I've seen how your mind operates... this is just the sort of thing it would latch on to.\"",
		"\"I know myths and legends are enticing, but in the end they're just stories for children... to teach them lessons, or to frighten them.\" He gestures toward the waves.",
		"\"No one's actually *seen* the Headless FALN Rider because he doesn't exist. He's an urban legend. A *legend*, meaning a story that's not real.\"",
		"\"There's nothing to wait for. We should get some rest, it's been a long day.\"",
		"\"Please tell me we're not here to look for a headless man in a tracksuit riding a horse... because there's no such thing.\"",
		"The lieutenant has his arms crossed, fingers tapping against his bicep. \"There, we waited. Nothing happened. Happy now?\"",
		"The lieutenant nods.",
		"\"Let's go. It's very late -- we should be resting already. Tomorrow will be another tough day.\"",
		"\"I don't know. It could have been quite a while.\" He looks you in the eye, as if inspecting your mental state.",
		"\"You dropped this -- are you okay to proceed?\"",
		"\"What happened?\"",
		"\"That does sometimes happen.\" He hands you the remains of your ledger.",
		"\"Right.\" he hands you the waterlogged remains of your ledger.",
		"\"There was a call on the shortwave: officer passed out in Martinaise.\" He furrows his brow. \"I had a feeling it would be you. I'm glad I got here in time.\"",
		"\"Mhmh. Now drink.\" He raises the canister.",
		"\"Good.\" He hands you the waterlogged remains of your ledger.",
		"\"Drink -- water.\" The lieutenant is extending a small canister to your mouth.",
		"\"Good.\"",
		"\"Ten minutes maybe.\"",
		"\"That's just a drug addict myth. In reality you're still comprised of dihydrogen oxide, which you must replenish to go on living.\"",
		"\"There is no use arguing with me. You will die if you don't.\" His voice is pressing: \"DRINK.\"",
		"\"Suit yourself.\" He caps the canister, uninterested in your petulance. With his brow furrowed he asks:",
		"\"But these are not the *Franconigerian centuries*. We are in the present. It is safe to sometimes drink water here.\" He hands you the canister.",
		"\"You were reading your paperwork. Then you passed out. I carried you to my Kineema... to take you to a hospital. Then you came to.\"",
		"\"I found this next to you.\" He pauses. \"I'll tag along for the rest of the day if you don't mind. My business is concluded anyway. Are you okay to go?\"",
		"\"Drink.\" He tilts the canister. \"You haven't drunk water in two days. Did you know the human body is not made to survive on alcohol *alone*? You need a secondary form of hydration.\"",
		"The lieutenant politely averts his eyes as two rivulets form on your cheeks.",
		"\"A little early in the day for a nap, isn't it?\" The lieutenant frowns at his wristwatch.",
		"\"Everything alright, detective?\"",
		"\"This again? Come on, detective. The joke has gone on long enough.\"",
		"\"Oh, for god's sake. This is a bunch of...\"",
		"\"It has been a long day.\" The lieutenant looks down at his wristwatch.",
		"\"It is rather late.\" The lieutenant looks down at his wristwatch.",
		"\"Indeed.\" The lieutenant nods thoughtfully. \"Let's see what's inside.\"",
		"\"That over there,\" he points to the strange-looking object, \"must be the buoy Klaasje told us about -- the one she hid her passport in. We should take a look.\"",
		"\"This wasn't a *real* identity, at least not as far as we know.\" He sighs. \"We should go.\"",
		"\"In my experience, cryptids are generally uninterested in travel documentation.\" He sighs. \"We should go.\"",
		"\"Well, damn.\"",
		"He purses his lips. \"Or *think* we do... This is a small loose end, either way. Not important I hope.\"",
		"\"I wouldn't go so far as to say that. This is only a small loose end. But I do wish we knew who took the documents.\"",
		"\"I have no idea.\" The lieutenant taps his foot, frowning.",
		"\"That may very well be the case. We should keep an eye on her.\" He sighs. \"Nothing more for us to do here. Let's go.\"",
		"\"Might have been Klaasje. Might have been the people after her. Might have been a local drunk.\" He shrugs. \"We should go.\"",
		"\"Mhm.\" No further response. All his concentration is on the contraption.",
		"\"Simple construction, very unsafe.\"",
		"\"Could be. We should keep an eye out.\" He sighs. \"Nothing more for us to do here. Let's go.\"",
		"The lieutenant flashes a mirthless half-smile. \"We still got here too late. There's nothing of use here anymore.\"",
		"\"Watch your mouth, Mr. Dros.\" The lieutenant squeezes the handle of his pistol.",
		"\"Detective?\" The lieutenant turns to you, with well disguised impatience.",
		"\"Mr. Dros -- are you aware you're confessing to murder?\" the lieutenant asks after a second of silence.",
		"\"Officer, a word...\" He gestures to talk to you on the side.",
		"\"And if you don't like it...\"",
		"Nothing else comes up. You see the lieutenant watch you try to stimulate thought processes by hitting yourself.",
		"\"You had direct visibility. There are embrasures in the concrete, *specifically* meant for a topfaller to use. And you had a long range rifle in your possession.\" The lieutenant softens his voice:",
		"\"The size fits, but not the sole...\" The lieutenant leans in to inspect.",
		"\"Did you *kill* him?\" The lieutenant takes a sudden step toward him.",
		"\"Show me the soles please, Mr. Dros.\"",
		"\"People *change* shoes, detective...\" He turns to the old man. \"It was you. You were there, weren't you, crawling in the Whirling-in-Rags...\"",
		"\"Not a lot of guns around that use military-grade ammunition, are there?\"",
		"\"Good...\" The lieutenant takes out his notebook and draws a single line.",
		"\"I don't understand.\" He turns to you. \"Do you, detective? I don't understand this part.\"",
		"\"No, c'mon.\" The lieutenant's impatient. \"A *word*, let's go.\"",
		"\"You've been here a long time, Mr. Dros -- too long. You clearly need medical aid...\"",
		"\"Why?\"",
		"The lieutenant looks at you with worry in his eyes.",
		"\"I'm sorry for what happened.\" The lieutenant softens his voice: \"But we're not *with* the Moralintern. We're Revacholian citizenry, like you.\"",
		"\"You must get around a lot -- to stay undetected all these years...\" The lieutenant's voice is soft, friendly. \"Do you know any *secret* paths? Pinball workshops?\"",
		"\"A beautiful, strong man sent here by the honourable private military company Krenel.\"",
		"\"So you watched the fight?\" The lieutenant points inland. \"Did you like what you saw? The mayhem? It was all your doing. Your plan. *You* got them killed.\"",
		"\"Are you *always looking* through the scope of a rifle?\" He explains: \"I'm just trying to *understand*.\"",
		"\"4.46 jacketed ammunition, modified for range,\" he lists. \"We have it. This is it.\"",
		"Nothing comes up. You see the lieutenant watch you try to stimulate thought processes by hitting yourself.",
		"The lieutenant raises his right arm to hush you...",
		"\"Officer, a word...\" He gestures to talk to you on the side.",
		"The lieutenant gives you a quick sideways glance and nods to acknowledge...",
		"\"Interesting.\" The lieutenant nods. \"During, or *after* the War?\"",
		"He leans closer. \"What were you doing? Some kind of reconnaissance? Preparing the scene? Listening in on her?\"",
		"\"You know what... You're right. I'm convinced this made the shot. Should we call it?\" The lieutenant looks at the weapon demonstratively.",
		"\"Officer, a word...\" The lieutenant wants to talk to you on the side, as you slap yourself furiously.",
		"\"Killing people?\"",
		"He does not answer the provocation. It does not look like he thinks this approach worked.",
		"\"...then you pull the trigger?\"",
		"The lieutenant raises his brow.",
		"You see the lieutenant watch you try to stimulate thought processes by hitting yourself.",
		"\"This feels good, doesn't it? Tying things up like this -- when you have the murder weapon, you have the killer.\"",
		"\"You've been here a long time, Mr. Dros -- too long. You need medical aid...\"",
		"\"The size fits, but not the sole...\" The lieutenant comes to the same conclusion.",
		"\"And you were looking at them -- the victim and a young woman -- having sex? Through the scope of your rifle that night? Before you shot him?\" The lieutenant takes out his notebook slowly, very slowly.",
		"\"We should first decide what to do with the body, before taking any other actions. Let's take another look at the body and talk things through.\"",
		"\"Good, we've examined the library card -- that should be enough for our colleagues. Now we can call the station from my Kineema and hand over the case.\"",
		"\"Good.\" He takes a note. \"We should give them a call from my Kineema, see if we can learn anything about Billie Méjean.\"",
		"\"We already decided to let the station handle this case, so there's no need for us to call the library.\"",
		"\"We suspect he might have been inebriated when he fell -- there were bottles all around him, and traces of vomit on his shirt.\"",
		"\"Assign it to someone else, Alice -- we've got enough on our plate.\"",
		"\"The man was about 173 cm tall, stout, with dark hair and a moustache. We suspect he might have been inebriated when he slipped -- there were bottles all around him, and traces of vomit on his shirt.\"",
		"\"No, we're not,\" the lieutenant rushes in to say. \"There is no evidence to suggest that this man was connected to the lynching -- or that we're dealing with a sequence killer here.\"",
		"\"It looked like a simple accident to me, Alice. No field autopsy necessary.\"",
		"\"It looked like an accident to me, Alice,\" the lieutenant rushes in to say. \"But that's for the guys in processing to confirm.\"",
		"\"A tragedy...\" The lieutenant looks in the can, eyes watering from the smell.",
		"\"But if all of this seems too much of a hassle, then there's also the option of reporting back to the station and leaving the case for our colleagues to solve.\"",
		"\"If we take the case then we have to identify the man and take care of the corpse. I can take the body to the morgue on my own or we can ask for the help of the Hardie boys.\"",
		"\"Alright. The station is going to want details, however. Let's make sure we didn't miss anything before we head back to my Kineema to make the call.\"",
		"\"Are you serious?\" The lieutenant's face changes immediately, taking on a more sombre expression.",
		"\"Great, we should call the library -- maybe it can provide us with a lead. That is, if we decide to take the case.\"",
		"\"Maybe, but we don't really have that much time or resources to spare. Still, if you want to go ahead -- be my guest.\"",
		"\"Good call.\"",
		"The lieutenant nods to himself, thinking. \"From where I stand I can see two options. We either take the case or report back to the station and leave it for our colleagues to handle.\"",
		"\"How long has he been dead? Did you *identify* him, search through his pockets? Is he still there?\"",
		"\"Taking the case would mean that we need to identify the man and take care of the corpse. I can take the body to the morgue on my own or we could ask for the help of the Hardie boys.\"",
		"\"Let's make sure we didn't miss anything -- especially any identifying information -- before we go.\"",
		"\"Field autopsy isn't necessary if the cause of death doesn't appear to be criminal -- and this looks like a simple accident to me.\"",
		"\"I'd say we should just write down 'head trauma' in the autopsy report and leave it at that. It would save us at least two hours of unnecessary work.\"",
		"\"We should also give the Jamrock Library a call, see if we can learn anything about this Billie Méjean.\"",
		"\"Alright. We're still going to have to call the station to let them know we're taking on an additional case, and so they can take away the body.\"",
		"\"That's it. We should get back to our case now that our duty here is done.\"",
		"\"But yes, that's on me. Let's get on with the murder investigation.\"",
		"\"I'll call the station tomorrow and let them know the name of the deceased.\"",
		"\"*Well*? No, it didn't.\"",
		"\"Sure, I'll call the station when we're done with the day. Let's go.\"",
		"\"It's alright, don't worry about it.\" His eyes wander over the sleeping district.",
		"\"Anyway, I'll call the station when we're finished with the day and let them know the name of the deceased.\"",
		"\"That's it. We should get back to our case. There's nothing more we can do here.\"",
		"\"You did well,\" the lieutenant says as soon as you've left the apartment. The balcony feels cool and quiet, with a stunning view over the sleeping district.",
		"\"It's alright, don't worry about it.\" His eyes wander over the streets.",
		"\"I'll call the station tomorrow and let them know the name of the deceased.\"",
		"\"Anyway, I'll call the station tomorrow and let them know the name of the deceased.\"",
		"\"I'll call the station when we're finished with the day and let them know the name of the deceased.\"",
		"\"So, the death notification...\" the lieutenant says as soon as you've left the apartment.",
		"\"There's not much we can do for them anymore, I'm afraid.\"",
		"He looks at you. \"And... officer -- I've seen worse. This wasn't the worst I've seen, okay? Now, let's go.\"",
		"\"Well, I'll call the station when we're done with the day and inform them about the identity of the deceased.\"",
		"\"Can't save the whole world, you know?\"",
		"\"You did enough.\" He pauses, rubbing his hands together to generate some heat.",
		"\"I'll call the station when we're finished with the day and let them know the name of the deceased.\"",
		"He nods. \"Let's go.\"",
		"\"They'll manage.\"",
		"\"Ballistics. Let him cook here for a minute or two -- we can have another look at the set-up he had there, with the mattress.\" He nods southeast to the tower. \"Ballistics always impresses these military types.\"",
		"\"Good.\" He nods. \"We're doing very good. He *wants* to confess -- I can see that. We just need to pile it on, a little more -- the more we have on him, the closer he is...\"",
		"\"Remember,\" the lieutenant whispers. \"He wants to tell us -- but he doesn't want to *help* us. It needs to look like we already have everything.\"",
		"He smiles. \"You should be proud. Come on -- let's wrap this up.\"",
		"\"Ballistics. Let him cook here for a minute or two -- we can have another look around the island for a sniper's nest.\" He looks to the small tower on the coast. \"I think we should check out the post.\"",
		"\"Yes, good going -- that should be our *first* priority.\"",
		"\"I can see that, yes. I'm not judging.\"",
		"\"Well, I can think of one thing. The gun.\" He smiles very politely. \"We should pick it up, and discuss it in front of him. Make a show of it.\"",
		"\"Remember,\" the lieutenant whispers. \"He wants to tell us -- but he doesn't want to *help* us. It needs to look like we already have everything.\"",
		"\"We just need to get him back to the mainland.\" A crooked little smile. \"We actually did it...\"",
		"\"Also, the gun.\" He smiles very politely. \"We should pick it up and discuss it in front of him. Make a show of it.\"",
		"\"He's a communard. The victim was a mercenary. We should get him talking politics again. You could even tell him we already *have* a motive.\"",
		"\"Oh yes...\" He nods. \"And -- he hasn't spoken to anybody in a long time. If we get him open, who knows what will pour out...\"",
		"He nods. \"From nothing to this in a day...\" A crooked little smile. \"This is *good*, we just need a confession first, and then *maybe* a solid motive later.\"",
		"... then at the man. \"How did you get in there? The hidden pinball workshop?\"",
		"\"How could you see what she looked like? You said it was dark.\"",
		"\"Sloppy, we should have gotten her to tell us about this...\" the lieutenant mutters to himself. \"Did you take the documents?\"",
		"\"You could tell she was a *spook* from the documents?\"",
		"\"We could get more...\" the lieutenant uses the opportunity to tell you -- in a lowered voice. \"We've got him talking...\"",
		"\"Did you keep the documents in it?\"",
		"In the silence, the lieutenant draws a line in his notes. Then nods at you once more.",
		"\"Past the Feld building, on the coast? What was she doing there?\"",
		"You hear the familiar scribble of the lieutenant's pen. A quick glance at you...",
		"\"Did you keep what was in it? When we found the submersible it was empty.\"",
		"In the silence, the lieutenant draws a line in his notes.",
		"The lieutenant nods at you, in acknowledgement.",
		"\"You had to open the steel door in the kitchen? How?\"",
		"\"You've been through the secret route behind the Whirling-in-Rags.\" The lieutenant interrupts.",
		"\"A red haired woman? Ruby...\"",
		"\"Did you make that hole?\"",
		"\"It was something else...\" He stutters. \"I don't remember. It was dark that morning. I only remember her face on the photo.\"",
		"\"One more thing -- the flowers, Mr. Dros. The dried flowers that were on the roof.\"",
		"\"But *that* nook too?\" The lieutenant does not let you finish.",
		"\"Khm,\" the lieutenant coughs.",
		"\"I don't think now is the time for this, officer.\" The lieutenant tries to nip it...",
		"\"I'm sorry, Mr. Dros,\" the lieutenant says, softly. \"I understand you knew him for a long time.\"",
		"\"You said you take painkillers...\" The lieutenant follows your lead.",
		"\"Mr. Dros, about this deal you made.\" He turns to him. \"With Edgar. The death of the Krenel mercenary was only *coincidentally* beneficial to the Claires. But...\" He leans closer.",
		"\"If you were to testify to this -- give the RCM something on Edgar -- you could walk.\" The lieutenant says in a voice even calmer, as if it were nothing at all.",
		"\"Save the treat for later?\" the lieutenant asks cheerfully.",
		"\"I don't think now is the time for this, officer.\" The lieutenant tries to nip it...",
		"\"What about the *other* people you've killed for them?\"",
		"\"We will have plenty of time to talk about this later, Mr. Dros.\" The lieutenant does not let him gloat. \"When you're in pre-detention -- it can take *years* in pre-detention.\"",
		"\"I don't think now is the time for this, officer.\" The lieutenant tries to nip it..",
		"\"I don't think now is the time for this, officer.\" The lieutenant tries to nip it...",
		"\"Officer!\" The lieutenant watches you beat yourself in the head -- to make a connection in the murder case.",
		"\"Again? What have you done for Edgar before?\"",
		"\"Did she?\" The lieutenant's voice is calm. \"They say her *daughter* called in, not her personally. But that wasn't really her daughter, was it?\"",
		"\"Yes. Shameful.\" The lieutenant takes a quick note. \"So many others to *punish* over the years -- isn't that right, detective?\" He turns to you.",
		"\"About this deal you made.\" The lieutenant immediately understands what is happening, and turns to the suspect.",
		"The lieutenant, too, has cocked his head and is looking at you with a strange expression.",
		"\"We would strike everything you've done and process you as a POW. You were in a war. You were on assignment. We could even extradite you to the Samaran People's Republic.\"",
		"The lieutenant gives you a nod. Go on, he seems to say.",
		"\"Like -- the previous forewoman of the Union.\"",
		"\"Mhm,\" the lieutenant hums. \"Straight to the open pit mine. Or cleaning up radiation in Severnaya Zemlja.\"",
		"\"The Claires wouldn't miss a man hidden in their own back yard -- not all this time. Nothing happens in Martinaise without them knowing.\"",
		"\"How did he know you were here?\"",
		"\"Edgar didn't keep his part of the deal.\"",
		"\"We will have plenty of time to talk about this, Mr. Dros.\" He does not let him gloat. \"When you're in pre-detention -- it takes *years* in pre-detention.\"",
		"\"I don't think now is the time for this, officer.\" The lieutenant tries to nip it...",
		"\"With Edgar. The death of the Krenel mercenary was only *coincidentally* beneficial to the Claires. But...\"",
		"The lieutenant shakes his head, frustrated. \"Who watches over him there while I come back for you?\"",
		"\"That could be part of the shock. But you're right -- something is off here. Mr. Dros...\" He touches the man's shoulder.",
		"\"His pupils appeared to be dilated. They still are...\" He examines the catatonic man's eyes.",
		"\"This sight is a T-9, Mr. Dros. Was it attached to the rifle, when you made the shot?\"",
		"He nods back and turns to the man sitting on the log. \"Iosef Lilianovich Dros, you are under arrest for the murder of the Krenel colonel. You will be taken to the nearest precinct holding area for preliminary investigation.\"",
		"\"Your confirmation is not required, sir.\" The lieutenant turns to you. \"Now -- on to the boat...\"",
		"\"What?\"",
		"\"The doctors will have to look at this. I hope your station has better medical personnel than 57. This is... a little advanced for a nurse.\"",
		"\"Officer -- are we sure?\" His voice is lowered. \"We could maybe get more.\"",
		"\"Your Wayfarer rights have been suspended. Information provided to the officers on the scene will be used against you by the prosecution. You will be given legal counsel within one week, and must face court in 44 days -- do you understand?\"",
		"\"This is no harmless old man.\" The lieutenant shakes his head.",
		"\"Which is why we should be very, very wary of approaching it again.\"",
		"\"This is a problem,\" the lieutenant says. \"Who watches over him while I come back for you?\"",
		"\"Old age and shock.\" He looks at him, then you.",
		"\"Let's have a closer look at that, after. I think I'll be more useful than him...\" He nods toward the old man.",
		"\"Be very, *very* careful,\" the lieutenant whispers, then takes a step toward the giant arthropod...",
		"He nods. \"He was energetic and articulate. After all these years alone, with little hygiene or medication I would expect worse.\"",
		"\"If Cuno kicked it into the sea, as he said he did -- the ebb would pull it back here. This makes sense. Mr. Dros could have picked it up. Or... the phasmid, even? If it did, this is incredible...\"",
		"\"The appearance of the phasmid, in conjunction with the stress of the arrest. He's spent his entire life here. For him to leave would be...\" He shakes his head.",
		"\"Mr. Dros?\"",
		"\"He does not seem to be *animated* now it's left...\" He looks to the sea. \"Honestly, I'm ready to believe anything at this point. Maybe it *is* psychoactive.\"",
		"\"A valid hunch. Long term exposure to something like that could be neurodegenerative... Also, please be careful when approaching unknown species in the future, detective.\"",
		"\"He hears us... The spirit?\"",
		"\"Actually, no...\" He scratches his head.",
		"\"I mean, why not? It's three metres tall...\" He takes off his glasses and cleans them -- when he puts them back on he's still staring at the sea.",
		"\"Not really.\" He shakes his head. \"We could escort him to the pier, then either one of us can take him inland while the other stays here, but...\"",
		"\"I can see it.\"",
		"\"I have absolutely forgotten to take notes. I hope I remember all of this.\" He shakes his head in disbelief. \"This will be one hell of a report -- thank *god* we have the photo.\"",
		"\"I can see it.\"",
		"\"Yes. The arrest and the appearance of the phasmid -- the combined stress...\" He looks at you. \"But you think it's something more than that, don't you?\"",
		"\"Hmm...\" He looks at the creature...",
		"\"Some kind of oxytocin release mechanism? Would go with the pupils. But this is way above me, detective.\"",
		"\"Told you? Yes. Good. During your *long* staring match. I understand.\" He looks at the man, then you.",
		"\"We should think about getting back to the mainland. To get help. He'll be safe here. If we don't take too long...\"",
		"\"We should try first. There is a prisoner transfer protocol that requires two...\"",
		"\"He's going into some kind of... psycho-motor immobility.\" The lieutenant inspects him gently. \"The good news is -- this solves our transportation problem. Doesn't it Mr. Dros?\"",
		"\"Try something else? We got him back for a moment.\"",
		"\"Maybe we could all fit in there...\" the lieutenant says.",
		"\"Do you understand?\"",
		"\"He lost the scope. Then it somehow made its way over there. With the help of a magpie phasmid?\" The lieutenant observes the lens sparkle in your hand.",
		"\"Okay,\" the lieutenant nods. \"How about *I* take him to the Precinct and you wait on the island?\"",
		"\"Humans are humans. Do you need... neurological tampering for the *glands* to work? I don't know...\"",
		"\"The scope, knowing of her bruises, his *disposition* toward Miss Oranje...\" He nods. \"I see what you mean.\"",
		"You feel the lieutenant's hand on your back. And then you hear him say four words:",
		"\"Officer...\" The lieutenant interrupts you at *under*. His voice is hushed. \"Are we sure? We could maybe get more...\"",
		"\"You come back for me? How about I go and send a boat back for you.\"",
		"\"Are you sure? You were looking at it for a *long* time. Almost as if you were hypnotized.\" He thinks. \"Were you hypnotized?\"",
		"\"Did you take this passport and other papers from a buoy on the coast?\"",
		"\"Mhm.\" The lieutenant inspects the man. \"Mr. Dros -- have you *ever* seen a stick insect, pretending to be the reeds?\"",
		"\"It's *three metres* tall. An undiscovered species. I'm not ready to believe in *anything* -- but yes, I'm ready to believe it has psychoactive qualities.\"",
		"\"You should be more careful, detective. Are you sure it wasn't having an *effect* on you?\"",
		"\"I have absolutely forgotten to take notes -- I hope I remember all of this.\" He shakes his head. \"This will be one hell of a report -- they'll think we're insane.\"",
		"\"No, no, it would take a whole day on this island. You go and transport the prisoner, I'll be here. I can escort him to the pier with you.\"",
		"\"Like a drug?\"",
		"\"He did seem distressed when it finally came to arresting him. Like he didn't want to leave this place. And the insect maybe...\" He looks at his notebook.",
		"\"Between this and the broken tyre he's used for a boat -- I think it's safe to leave him here, while we go and get help. It will need to be medical first, I'm afraid.\"",
		"... and then it's gone. Drowned out by the lieutenant's voice -- \"Maybe there is room for three on the boat...\"",
		"\"Then how did *we* see it?\" He thinks. \"Oh, you mean whatever does this, does it over *time*? Teenagers, kids, drunks -- sightings are brief. And hence not credible. Anyone who spends a long time with it...\"",
		"\"You mean pheromonal?\"",
		"\"Not as far as I could see. There were other things there, though...\" He turns to you.",
		"\"Yes -- it's very okay.\"",
		"It doesn't look like the lieutenant wishes you to push this angle further.",
		"\"I tried to... but I only got a blur.\"",
		"\"Odder still -- he is also a Mazovian socio-economist, who believes in liquidating the ruling class. How he reconciles these two points of view, I do not know -- but he is *vocal* on both of them.\"",
		"\"He apprehended a straggler who stayed hidden for fifty years, ever since the Revolution; who's probably committed other murders over those years...\" He pauses. \"Oh -- and he also discovered a new species.\"",
		"\"No, detective -- we *have* a motive...\" He gestures for you to speak up.",
		"\"*Possibly* induced,\" he corrects you. \"But even without that -- this man spent fifty years on the islands in the bay. In solitude. Loathing what Revachol has become. There's plenty for prosecution to pick from in terms of motive.\"",
		"\"The RCM consists of policemen of the state that *is*. So -- a little discrepancy there.\" He turns back to Vicquemare.",
		"\"It's worrying. Especially in light of his political views. Detective Du Bois is -- as you may know -- a fascist. A far-right woman-hater and, of course, also into race-stuff. Which -- for a police officer --\" He shakes his head. \"Not good.\"",
		"\"Wait, it's better if I...\" he says in a lowered voice.",
		"\"Well...\" A cold gust of wind. He pulls up his collar. \"The drinking, the lost gun, also losing his badge -- that's all true. *And* he's been drinking on the job.\"",
		"\"Odder still -- he is also an ultraliberal 'hustler' who is always...\" The lieutenant pinches the root of his nose. \"*On the grind.* How he reconciles these two points of view, I do not know -- but he is vocal about both of them.\"",
		"\"Other than that one time, he has tirelessly worked on the case. And he solved it. We have a confession, a murder weapon, *and* the perpetrator -- locked on the island right now, awaiting transportation.\"",
		"\"A colossal stick insect. It was on the island, camouflaged as the reeds. It... unfolded from the reeds. I think we may be dealing with the Insulindian phasmid.\"",
		"\"When you were out.\"",
		"\"There was a *fridge* we needed. And a possible witness. He was just chasing a lead and ended up advising a local shopkeeper -- it was okay.\"",
		"\"He didn't quite *solve* it -- he cross-pollinated information between the company rep and Evrart. Until the rep came to see that the Union desires war. At which point Mrs. Messier decided to...\" He shrugs.",
		"\"He did everything he could,\" the lieutenant interrupts him. \"*We* did everything we could. The company hired unvetted mercenaries. Lieutenant Du Bois got between them and the locals.\"",
		"\"And then there's the motor carriage in the sea -- something I was *not* present for...\" He breathes in sharply. \"But -- despite all this -- he is a great detective. One of the best I've seen, in fact.\"",
		"\"I know this sounds fantastic. But I'm a four times decorated lieutenant of the RCM. I do not make up encounters with *cryptids* to spice up my day. I am very, very sane.\"",
		"\"It's worrying. Especially considering his political views. Detective Du Bois is -- as you may know -- a Mazovian socio-economist. He wants to liquidate the ruling class. Which -- again -- for a police officer... is a little odd.\"",
		"\"Actually -- you didn't.\"",
		"\"Detective, it's better if *I* do that...\" he says in a lowered voice.",
		"\"He did so at considerable risk to his own life. He was shot -- not once, but twice. We stopped an execution, not a negotiation. The loss of life was minimal compared to what it could have been.\"",
		"\"On the case?\"",
		"\"It's just strange. Especially in light of his political views. Detective Du Bois is -- as you may know -- a true blue moralist. A man of the centre. Not prone to political outbursts. Which is commendable. But also... at odds with his behaviour.\"",
		"\"Detective?\" He turns to you.",
		"\"It's just strange. Especially in light of his political views. Detective Du Bois is -- as you may know -- a true blue moralist. A man of the centre. Not prone to political outbursts. Which is commendable. But also... at odds with his behaviour.\"",
		"\"He can talk human beings into telling him anything. And he doesn't stop. In all the time I've spent with him, he has not once stopped working on the case. He is tireless. Madly driven.\"",
		"\"Because I'm a police detective. And manufacturing drugs is *illegal*.\"",
		"\"No. I know what I saw. It was *real*.\"",
		"\"Yes -- but *also*...\"",
		"\"Nothing is off the table, but -- I want to stress this -- the find does not have to be connected to the case. The case is 100% prosecutable -- without *any* kairomones.\"",
		"\"A strange psychosexual fixation. Aggravated -- possibly -- by proximity to the phasmid and its chemicals. He himself gave a political reason -- said he had killed an enemy combatant.\"",
		"\"Yes -- until we stopped it.\" The lieutenant is quick to correct him. \"He saw the mercenary as an *enemy combatant* -- there's plenty for prosecution to pick from, as far as motive is concerned.\"",
		"\"I don't even know which jacket he's talking about. There have been... many things that he's found. He gets meticulous. But it's okay.\"",
		"\"It's worrying. Especially considering his political views. Detective Du Bois is -- as you may know -- a Mazovian socio-economist. He wants to liquidate the ruling class. Which -- again -- for a police officer... is a little odd.\"",
		"\"Well, except that one time when he stopped to sing karaoke. Which -- by the way -- was a valiant effort. He really sang his heart out.\"",
		"He takes out the photo of the phasmid and shows it to the officers across the yard. The wind blows, flapping the glossy rectangle in his hand.",
		"\"Yes -- but *also*...\"",
		"\"I told them a police raid will sweep the church in two days. Which, by the way -- it will. If they have any brains they won't be producing in there.\"",
		"\"Also -- we have ballistics from the gun, matching the bullet found in the dead mercenary's head. *And* two officers on the scene that Mr. Dros *confessed* to.\"",
		"\"He did so at considerable risk to his own life. He was shot, and survived only because of his armour. We stopped an execution, not a negotiation. The loss of life was minimal compared to what it could have been.\"",
		"\"You had to see it... It had the subdued colours of a female. And the nesting behaviour too, I think.\"",
		"\"It's not *quite* like that... The move allowed us to stabilize things here. It was *not* bad for Martinaise. And we don't owe anyone anything.\"",
		"\"Don't make this *harder* for yourself,\" he says in a lowered voice.",
		"\"Well...\" He pulls up his collar. \"The drinking, the gun-losing, also losing the badge -- that's all true. Although he has *not* been drinking on the job this week.\"",
		"\"As you can see -- it's about three metres tall. In fact, we think it may be the largest land invertebrate ever discovered.\"",
		"\"Well... except that one time when he stopped to sing karaoke. Which, by the way -- I have to disagree with you, Mr. Vicquemare -- was a valiant effort. He really sang his heart out.\"",
		"He takes out the photo and shows it to the officers across the yard. Rain comes down, he covers the glossy photo of the phasmid with his hand.",
		"\"The old man was not *aware* of the phasmid's presence. Exhibiting a strange, atypical dementia, he fell into a stupor after its appearance. He became near-catatonic.\"",
		"\"No. It's *nothing* like that. He was reckless with information -- but ethical. We don't owe anyone anything. This allowed us to stabilize things in Martinaise.\"",
		"\"Then there's the... self-flagellation issue. He likes to apologize -- profusely. Making it sound like he's guilty of at least first degree murder. It's not a good communication strategy for an officer. It's...\"",
		"\"It's worrying. Especially in light of his political views. Detective Du Bois is -- as you may know -- a fascist. A far-right woman-hater and, of course, also into race-stuff. Which -- for a police officer --\" He shakes his head. \"Not good.\"",
		"\"No. He just let some youths set up a club in the church. They *thought* they could produce in there. They won't. The building was abandoned. It was an okay idea -- better than having them out on the ice.\"",
		"\"He apprehended a revolutionary brigade who stayed hidden for fifty years, ever since the Revolution; who's probably committed other murders over those years...\" He pauses. \"Oh -- and he also discovered a new species.\"",
		"He takes out the photo and shows it to the officers across the yard. Thick white snow falls all around you -- flakes stick to the glossy photo of the phasmid.",
		"\"No. I wouldn't say it was...\" He looks to you.",
		"\"And he *solved* it. Near-perfectly. In one week we have: a confession, a murder weapon -- *and* the perpetrator. Locked on the island right now, awaiting transportation.\"",
		"He nods. \"A strange psychosexual fascination. The result of spending all this time in solitude, on the islands of this bay... And trauma too. He himself gave a political reason. In his mind, he had killed an enemy combatant.\"",

		"\"Odder still -- he is also a full blown fascist. An ultranationalist woman-hater and more than a little racist. How he reconciles these two points of view...\" He shrugs. \"But he is *vocal* about both.\"",
		"\"Odder still -- he is also a full blown fascist. An ultranationalist woman-hater and more than a little racist. Which, I guess, goes well with the *grind*? I do not know -- but he is *vocal* about both beliefs.\"",
		"\"The killer did not seem to be *aware* of the phasmid's presence. Exhibiting a strange, atypical dementia, he fell into a stupor after its appearance. He became near-catatonic.\"",
		"\"I had a major collision with him on the subject. He yielded, and is now striving to be a crypto-fascist. That is: a regular police officer who *thinks* these things but doesn't say them. So that's... yeah.\"",
		"\"A colossal stick insect -- three metres tall. It's on the island, camouflaged as the reeds. It... unfolded from them. I did not -- unfortunately -- get a photo. But I believe it may have been the Insulindian phasmid.\"",
		"\"Yes, but also reed-coloured -- beige and brown, a little green -- on the outside. After unfolding from a single stalk, it still retained parts that looked like reed tufts on its limbs.\"",
		"\"Also -- we have a sniper's nest with full view of the room in which the mercenary died. Right on the island. *And* two officers on the scene that Mr. Dros *confessed* to.\"",
		"\"He did so at considerable risk to his person. Remember -- he was shot. We stopped an execution, not a negotiation. The loss of life was minimal compared to what it could have been.\"",

		"\"This is a conversation for when we are no longer out in the open, in Martinaise, where Evrart and Edgar Claire have ears everywhere.\" The lieutenant lowers his voice -- just a little.",
		"\"Four kids were living in a tent on the ice. They were going to drown when it melted. It's not optimal, but the building *was* abandoned. So he put them in there. It's okay.\"",
		"\"There was a possible witness in there. And it was close to the crime scene. He was just chasing a lead and ended up advising a local shopkeeper -- it was okay.\"",
		"\"Stop being sorry for five minutes,\" he says in a lowered voice.",
		"\"Then there's the... superstardom. He likes to -- from time to time -- allude to being a *superstar law official*. At first I thought it was a joke, but... now I'm not so sure. He says *disco* about twenty times a day.\"",
		"\"Me neither.\"",
		"\"A clue? You think our suspect is a seagull who's been defecating on unsuspecting jackets?\"",

		"The lieutenant looks at your feet with some concern, but makes no comment.",
		"The lieutenant looks at you standing there shivering with some concern, but makes no comment.",

		"The lieutenant sighs. \"Is that really the impression you want to give people?\"",
		"\"To be perfectly blunt, you're dressed like a bum. And you smell like one, too.\"",
		"\"Anyway, we should probably get back to the case. Let's go.\"",

		"\"Now -- if it were any other day, I would excuse myself for the night. But we have more pressing matters. We need to wrap up this investigation and we need to do it *fast*.\"",
		"\"Let me ask you something...\" He leans in to inspect you.",
		"\"Be serious a moment, please...\"",
		"\"What kind of *future* are we talking about here?\"",
		"\"What's *my* problem?\" he says, his voice rising with indignation...",
		"\"Detective, enough. I don't want to hear about your degenerate ravings. I've heard *plenty* as it is. Just stop.\"",
		"\"I don't suppose anyone ever questions whether you belong here. No matter how badly you fuck up, no matter what a mess you make, you never *stop* being Revacholian...\"",
		"\"People call me all sorts of things. But you know the one thing they *never* call me?\"",
		"\"Now -- if it were any other day, I would excuse myself for the night. But we have more pressing matters. We need to get to the island -- and we need to do it as soon as possible.\"",
		"\"A tremendous evolutionary advantage, I'm sure. But perhaps we've had enough speculative biology for today?\"",
		"\"If the body of the creature was found,\" the lieutenant can't help himself, \"why aren't there detailed illustrations of it in science textbooks? Confirming the existence of this very lethal species?\"",
		"\"And I *don't*. Just one.\"",
		"The lieutenant pauses thoughtfully.",
		"The lieutenant leans in. \"Hey, you promised you'd only ask about one cryptid.\"",
		"The lieutenant leans in. \"Hey, you promised you'd only ask about *one* cryptid.\"",
		"He nods approvingly.",
		"The lieutenant pauses thoughtfully.",
		"\"We don't have time for Cryptozoology 101. Let's get back to work, shall we?\"",
		"He nods approvingly.",
		"\"Okay. I won't spoil your fun,\" the lieutenant concedes. \"What is the invisible cryptid?\"",
		"The lieutenant pauses thoughtfully.",
		"\"Ah, fuck it. Let's have more cryptids.\"",
		"He nods approvingly.",
		"\"Of course. All fairy tales have someone or something invisible in them.\"",
		"The lieutenant leans in. \"Hey, you promised you'd only ask about one cryptid.\"",
		"The lieutenant mutters something under his breath but nods for you to go ahead.",
		"\"Yes, advantages such as the flakier texture of Seolite earwax, or so I've heard. Nothing inspires pride in one's species quite like speculative evolutionary biology. Perhaps we've had enough of that for today?\"",
		"The lieutenant pauses thoughtfully.",
		"\"Ah, fuck it. Let's have more cryptids.\"",
		"The lieutenant pauses thoughtfully.",
		"He nods approvingly.",
		"The lieutenant leans in. \"Hey, you promised you'd only ask about one cryptid.\"",
		"\"This one -- I liked,\" the lieutenant puts down his notes. \"Not only does it have eight eyes, *and* is a living fossil, *and* the largest bird ever to live. It also does mind control.\"",
		"The lieutenant shuts his eyes briefly...",
		"\"Ah, fuck it. Let's have more cryptids.\"",
		"The lieutenant throws you one of his *looks*. \"*One* cryptid -- not a couple. One. This won't turn into some kind of cryptid extravaganza.\"",
		"The lieutenant looks at you, pleasantly surprised.",
		"\"That's not how the world works. Let's get back to our investigation, shall we?\"",
		"He gives Lena a look communicating something between disgust and exasperation. \"Ma'am, you're *confusing* him.\"",
		"The lieutenant leans in. \"Hey, you promised you'd only ask about one cryptid.\"",
		"He nods and assumes a waiting posture.",
		"\"I'm glad you see it that way.\" He nods approvingly. \"Did we have anything more to do here?\"",
		"\"Ah, fuck it. Let's have more cryptids.\"",
		"\"Of course. A common thread in these -- disappearance and unfalsifiability...\" He concedes: \"I liked the story, though, ma'am.\"",
		"\"Uhm... Do we have time for *breaks* to listen to theories about imaginary animals?\"",
		"\"Ah, fuck it. Let's have more cryptids.\"",
		"The lieutenant throws you one of his *looks*. \"*One* cryptid -- like you said. One. This can't turn into some kind of cryptid extravaganza. We have things to do.\"",
		"\"It's actually *a little* hard to see.\" He looks at her sceptically. \"But do go on.\"",
		"\"Fine I'll bite.\" The lieutenant looks at her sceptically. \"How can an animal be a sound?\"",
		"He looks at you with wonder and sincere pity. \"I'm beginning to wonder if I should.\"",
		"\"Hooey,\" the lieutenant interjects. \"No animal can be that large. It's a mirage.\"",
		"\"A *detective*.\" He finishes the sentence for him, then his tone turns surprising mild. \"Pardon me, I did not wish to seek conflict. It's simply my training to question things.\"",
		"\"Of course you do.\"",
		"\"Which one?\" He hasn't been paying attention.",
		"\"Mhm. The *burning rhino* is where they draw the line.\" He's unimpressed.",
		"\"A lavender shadow...\" He smirks.",
		"\"What?\"",
		"\"Okay then,\" he concedes.",
		"\"What the hell are you signing us up for here?\"",
		"\"Did you know I don't like bad addict cops?\" He stares at you over his glasses. \"Almost no one in the RCM does.\"",
		"Not a single muscle moves on the lieutenant's face.",
		"\"Cool.\" He stares at you over his glasses. \"No, no -- really. Rock and roll.\"",
		"There is no movement on the lieutenant's face as he stares intently at the trash container.",
		"The lieutenant flashes you a sharp look, but doesn't say anything.",
		"\"Another sane decision, detective.\"",
		"\"That's charming.\"",
		"The lieutenant shrugs. \"I'm not here to tell you what to do, detective.\"",
		"\"You really took an interest in that old soldier.\" The lieutenant sounds surprised. \"I guess there's no harm taking the picture. The dockworkers would probably throw it in the trash anyway.\"",
		"\"Why did you take that?\" the lieutenant asks, glancing at the photo.",
		"\"I don't know about stealing people's *very colourful* clothes like that...\" He looks on disapprovingly.",
		"\"Let's get going,\" the lieutenant says impatiently. \"The entire neighbourhood can see us up here.\"",
		"\"If you must.\" The lieutenant looks around. \"But please hurry -- we're pretty easy to spot up here.\"",
		"\"I suppose René is not going to be needing it anymore.\" He studies the uniform. \"It's a bit too colourful for my taste, though.\"",
		"\"Fine.\" He nods. \"But let's move. I don't want to be seen snooping around here.\"",
		"\"You're *really* interested in that old soldier,\" he remarks, surprised. \"Not sure I understand your fascination, but sure -- as long as it doesn't take up a whole lot of time.\"",
		"\"Of course you are,\" he says matter-of-factly. \"What murder investigation would be complete without an arbitrary photo collage.\"",
		"\"Fantastic. Try not to wear it with other similarly colourful clothes, okay?\"",
		"\"It means the whole scene was long and drawn out. Like it was from a *film*.\"",
		"\"We know Ruby was the driver. We know that's your *affiliation* with her.\" He taps on his notebook. \"Detective, you want to deliver the coup de grace?\"",
		"\"Not quite yet, Mr. Hardie. There were eight sets of prints on the crime scene. There are only seven Hardie boys here.\"",
		"\"Yes. Death threats,\" he says calmly. \"My partner meant *before* he was hanged.\"",
		"\"Indeed. *Mighty*. How did it get there?\" The lieutenant is fixed on Titus.",
		"\"I would though,\" he says, as casually as if he were commenting on the weather.",
		"\"Right. I'm convinced, Glen.\" He nods sarcastically. \"Nothing off here. Just a regular hanging.\"",
		"\"Shanky -- it's Shanky, right?\" He doesn't wait for an answer. \"I thought there's something wrong about the lynching story. Now I *know* there was.\"",
		"\"No, he meant *before* he was hanged. Did you shoot him *before* you hanged him?\"",
		"\"There was a bullet in the dead man's brain,\" the lieutenant checks his notes. \"Why was it there, if you hanged him?\"",
		"\"For the record -- which I have to type up later tonight -- no apocalypse related testimony was provided to us by the witness.\"",
		"\"Thank you.\" He turns to face the man. \"You're right, Titus. There is no local drug trade, because it's all controlled by *you*. *You're* the drug trade.\"",
		"You can almost see the blood curdle in  the lieutenant's veins. Miraculously he remains silent.",
		"\"The person driving it was present at the hanging. It was one of you. We've connected the footprints.\" He taps on his notebook, then turns to you. \"Detective, do you want to deliver the coup de grace?\"",
		"\"I know you're lying, Shanky.\" He writes in his notebook.",
		"\"We'll do that. In the meantime,\" he points south, \"did you know that there's an abandoned lorry at the intersection that was used to move raw ingredients for drugs from Terminal B to Jamrock?\"",
		"\"What happened?\" the lieutenant half-whispers, \"We got absolutely *wiped*. Let's go before it gets worse.\"",
		"\"But...\" The lieutenant looks worried, he whispers: \"I don't want to give you my gun. Not after the last time.\"",
		"\"We are deep, *deep* in farce territory,\" the lieutenant whispers to you, taking a step closer to the door. \"We need to cool off and re-engage, *later*.\"",
		"\"Thank you.\" He returns it to his holster, then looks at the room: \"Nothing to worry about here, people -- my partner likes to play these jokes. He's what you call *dark*.\"",
		"\"Why? You have a gun.\"",
		"\"Yes -- shit, faeces, poop -- scatological jokes,\" the lieutenant concludes dryly . \"If you don't have anything more to say, then we're going to go back to asking questions.\"",
		"\"It would help if we establish a timeline.\"",
		"\"Let's just all cool off,\" the lieutenant says, trying to salvage the situation. \"We had some questions, that's all.\"",
		"\"Nothing. Just a minor misunderstanding. Let's return to questions -- officer?\"",
		"\"We'll solve the case. Look at me. Don't worry.\" He appears calm suddenly. \"This *demonstration* is not helping. At all.\"",
		"The lieutenant turns to you. \"Unless you had questions, we should get some air.\"",
		"\"He's not racist and there is no rally.\" He turns to you. \"There is no Carly either, it's a joke. Let's move on -- or get some air.\"",
		"\"But...\" The lieutenant looks worried, he whispers: \"I don't want to give you my gun.\"",
		"\"What are you doing?!\" The short cold barrel touches your lips. It tastes like iron and hell.",
		"\"What is her name?\" The lieutenant takes out his notes.",
		"\"I assure you, there is no crisis,\" the lieutenant tries to salvage the situation. \"We had questions, that's all.\"",
		"\"There is no Carly and there is no kindergarten,\" the lieutenant says to you, concerned you might not get it. \"It's a joke and we're getting derailed.\"",
		"\"Police job?\" He tilts his head to the side, as if inspecting you. A brief moment passes. In silence. Then...",
		"\"Live in a bar. Sit on their fat asses like they own the place, while the neighbourhood goes to shit, corpses hang from trees, kids shoot up...\"",
		"\"Merely *what*...?\" He doesn't quite catch that last word. A brief moment passes in silence, then...",
		"\"Detective.\" He thinks of putting his hand on your shoulder, then doesn't. \"We don't have to demonstrate anything, let's just get back to the questions.\"",
		"Silence. He tilts his head to the side, inspecting you. A brief moment passes, then...",
		"\"Thank you.\" He quickly returns the gun to his holster, then looks at the room. \"So -- questions?\"",
		"\"There's no mass-execution, officer.\" He looks at you, concerned. \"Just ask questions and don't get sidetracked.\"",
		"\"No. That is not what is happening.\" He turns to you. \"This *show* is unnecessary. Give me my gun. Now.\"",
		"\"Again -- it was a dark joke.\" He turns to you. \"Maybe we should go for a little walk, joker? Before we continue? Jogging around seems to have a positive effect on you.\"",
		"\"How well do you *know* her?\"",
		"\"Nothing.\" He gives you a sideways glance. \"We just have a *few* more questions -- then we'll be on our way.\"",
		"\"K-Klaasje?\"",
		"\"Why? You have your own gun.\"",
		"\"Be careful -- it's loaded.\" He unholsters and gives you his firearm. It feels oddly light and buzzing in your hand. Like a funny toy.",
		"\"Why?\"",
		"\"Congratulations on the graffito removal.\" He turns to Titus. \"All I see is you sitting around talking about *Monica's titties* -- while there's a rape victim.\"",
		"\"No,\" he whispers, not even looking at you. \"Not going to happen.\"",
		"The lieutenant nods and turns to address the room: \"You know what? You guys *must* be the cops. Because this is what cops do, right?\"",
		"\"Ehm...\"",
		"\"Uhm...\" He hesitates. \"And what *is* that?\"",
		"\"Nothing. Give me the gun.\"",
		"\"These people are trained military professionals. With decades of combat experience. They're not a gang, or a *Barmy Army*.\"",
		"\"All he means is that the situation is serious.\"",
		"\"These people are trained military professionals. Special forces, as you said. They're not a gang, or a *Barmy Army*.\"",
		"\"Lost gun or not, you're going to need help.\" The lieutenant looks Titus in the eye. \"We're offering it.\"",
		"\"This is what happens if you take the law into your own hands. Other people start doing it too.\"",
		"\"No he won't.\" The lieutenant adjusts his glasses. \"This is probably some kind of a joke.\"",
		"\"That's enough for you today,\" the lieutenant says quietly. \"Let's conclude this call.\"",
		"\"More ammo on our belt for the remainder of the investigation. Good find, detective.\"",
		"\"You're right.\" The lieutenant looks at the pile. \"This certainly confirms the theory that the belt must've come from inside the harbour.\"",
		"\"You're right. This is probably where Titus and his men got the belt.\" The lieutenant looks at the pile.",
		"\"Hmh...\" The lieutenant seems incredulous.",
		"The lieutenant does not bow to the flag -- it accepts your salute with quiet dignity.",
		"\"Mhm.\" He looks around the apartment. \"The tenant is an *old fashioned* guy.\"",
		"\"Personally, I find it helps to keep up a few hobbies.\"",
		"\"The first row represents your years of service. *Eighteen* years? Okay -- not bad at all. What did you do before you volunteered?\"",
		"\"Cool. I'm glad you joined us. Not a lot of money in doomcrying... Let's move on, shall we?\"",
		"\"Ah, Martinaise at night,\" he smells the air and says.",
		"\"Oh yes. Coal City, Le Royaume, the Burnt Out Quarter...\"",
		"\"But it seems as though you are, or at least *were*, one of the good ones. So we have that to be thankful for.\"",
		"\"This next row -- the one that wraps all the way around -- is your number of closed cases. *Closed* is good. It means finished. You've got, let's see...\"",
		"\"Right. Those are your confirmed kills. You've got precisely *three* perforations there.\"",
		"The lieutenant nods.",
		"\"Right here,\" he says, his finger near the top of the map, on a segment of coast jutting out into the great ocean.",
		"\"Very noble of you. Are we done here?\"",
		"\"Ah, Martinaise,\" he smells the air and says.",
		"\"Maybe you were a diplomat? Or in PR? Doesn't matter, I suppose... Let's move on, shall we?\"",
		"\"Why not gardening? You've already got the yellow gloves...\"",
		"\"Yes, that *does* seem quite likely. Your youth coincided with some heady days for Revachol. But let's move on, shall we?\"",
		"\"Ah, right. Sometimes the brain's able to preserve certain responses even when conscious memory has been... let's say... *misplaced*...\"",
		"\"For an RCM officer -- especially Precinct 41, which is in the Jamrock Quarter -- it's rather... tame. I mean that in a good way.\"",
		"\"There are certain officers who treat their kills like some kind of ghoulish game. If they do happen to *solve* a case it's usually by accident.\" It's obvious the lieutenant doesn't think very highly of these officers...",
		"\"If you want to pour out the booze you've been carrying around *on duty*, I'm certainly not going to stop you...\"",
		"The lieutenant nods with evident respect. \"It's quite a lot, even for someone who's been on the force for nearly two decades. Usually clearing more than 10 cases a year puts you in the 90th percentile of *all* RCM officers...\"",
		"\"Right. I'll go turn off the lights...\" He presses a remote control on the key.",
		"\"Why not historical reenactment? You've already got that turn of the century revolutionary hat...\"",
		"\"Anything's better than annihilating yourself with drugs and alcohol...\"",
		"\"You know, the RCM is a volunteer's organization. We would have no qualms with vagrants joining our ranks were they qualified... but let's move on, shall we?\"",
		"\"Why not historical reenactment? You've already got that antique carabineer gear...\"",
		"\"Those are *perforations*. They represent your record as an officer of the RCM. They're your statistics, as it were. I should have guessed you'd keep a record, officers often do. Let's take a look...\"",
		"\"That's right,\" the lieutenant says, gauging your reaction. \"How did you know?\"",
		"\"Oh, this and that. Let's not get into it now.\"",
		"\"Fair point... Let's move on, shall we?\"",
		"\"It's *quite* a lot, even for someone who's been on the force for nearly two decades. Usually clearing more than 10 cases a year puts you in the 90th percentile of *all* RCM officers...\"",
		"\"That's what it says. I might've guessed even longer based on your age... what did you do all those blissful years of your youth?\"",
		"\"Why not take up a sport? You've already got that FALN gear...\"",
		"\"No -- it does *not*,\" the lieutenant says without optimism.",
		"\"Neither am I. Are we done here?\"",
		"\"Call it what you want. You were a valuable member of your precinct. Now, let's look at the last row...\"",
		"\"Yes,\" he says, declining to elaborate.",
		"\"Suit yourself...\"",
		"\"There she is: Revachol West.\" There's a note of pride in the lieutenant's voice.",
		"\"Wow, more than 200!\"",
		"\"No shame in working a regular job, detective. Sometimes after a long day of doing *this*, I even envy it... Let's move on, shall we?\"",
		"\"Let me see.\" He takes the ledger for a moment and inspects it.",
		"\"Definitely not.\"",
		"\"As you will...\"",
		"\"It has its problems...\"",
		"\"Everyone has their own method of coping, some more effective, or self-destructive, than others...\" He gives you a meaningful look.",
		"The lieutenant sighs.",
		"\"What brings you here, madam?\"",
		"\"Thank you, ma'am. Do keep an eye on your boat.\"",
		"\"Do we?\" He glances at his watch. It doesn't look like he does.",
		"\"Fortunately for you, madam, the RCM is on the scene.\"",
		"\"We should ask that girl on the ice what's going on here.\" The lieutenant gestures toward the young woman next to the tent.",
		"\"It looks like a makeshift bridge.\" The lieutenant adjusts his collar against a cool breeze. \"Could be convenient.\"",
		"\"Getting late. We should call it a day... no point in lingering here on the plaza.\"",
		"\"A rather uninviting bench,\" the lieutenant notes. \"I'm not one for sitting on benches anyway -- before the murder investigation is solved.\"",
		"\"Getting late. We should call it a day... best not sleep outside on the wind-stricken coast.\"",
		"\"Hmh...\" The lieutenant looks down the street. \"We can sit on benches after we've solved the murder. Let's go.\"",
		"\"I can't see how that was worth the ruckus...\" He looks at the crate. \"Except for seeing the crane in action. Which, I admit, was satisfying.\"",
		"\"Now, let's move on. I find this subject tiresome.\"",
		"He smirks. \"Nothing from surreptitious recordings collected by Seolite agents in an effort to compromise the Militia.\"",
		"\"Yes. Now, let's move on. I find this subject tiresome.\"",
		"\"There is no Seolite Conspiracy, and even if there were, I would not be a part of it.\"",
		"\"I don't care what that delinquent said.\"",
		"\"I was born and raised Revacholian. So was my mother. As for my father, I didn't know him, I don't know who he was. And I don't care. From what I've heard, he wasn't a very pleasant person to be around.\"",
		"\"At least you were forthcoming with your doubt. Now, let's move on. I find this subject tiresome.\"",
		"He leans back and studies you with a look of grave concern.",
		"\"My... people? What are you talking about?\"",
		"\"I respect you as a colleague, and so I will have this conversation with you, but only once.\"",
		"The lieutenant is waiting patiently, tapping his foot lightly to a tune only he can hear.",
		"The lieutenant sighs, takes off his glasses, and breathes on the lenses, fogging up the glass. As he wipes them clean on his jacket, he begins speaking.",
		"\"And no such recordings exist, to my knowledge. Seol has bigger squid to fry.\"",
		"\"In case you've forgotten, men and women in our profession rarely make it to retirement -- and certainly not if they do not trust their partners.\"",
		"He gestures for you to stop.",
		"\"But that there was an interesting find -- an alternative path into the harbour that the kid uses. Well done.\"",
		"\"Perhaps not?\" He looks at you. \"This is below our pay grade, detective. However...\" He points to the ladder in the corner.",
		"\"Of course, detective. *Swift* justice. Don't worry, we don't have to investigate every trace of narcotics...\" The lieutenant points to the ladder in the corner.",
		"\"See that *ladder* there? It's probably another way into the industrial harbour, no? A secret path the local kids use.\"",
		"The lieutenant isn't studying the powder in the mirror. He's studying you.",
		"\"No, I'm just a *regular* detective. Thank you very much.\"",
		"The lieutenant looks around. \"True, they never cleaned up the war damage... The rest of Revachol looks better, though.\"",
		"\"The bridge is fine enough. Locals use it all the time, after all. It's nothing to worry about.\" He adjusts his glasses. \"Shall we?\"",
		"\"Could it be another Stas-Rajko murder?\" He gives you a crooked smile. \"Honestly, that just doesn't seem like the type of vehicle our dead guy would drive, so my initial guess is the two are not related.\"",
		"He studies his reflection in the car window. \"Four years for murder in Reunion.\"",
		"\"A Stas-Rajko, KK-2. That's a classic model,\" the lieutenant replies with a nod. \"Never thought I'd see another one repainted after what happened last time.\"",
		"\"Is that so, officer? I'll take you at your word.\"",
		"\"You sure you're not Zsiemsk?\" He shares a smile with you, only for a second.",
		"\"They said it was an honour killing. Hussar-style. The Zsiemsk community protested the trial, flying the colours.\" He shakes his head. \"Five thousand came to protest.\"",
		"\"An old case from my precinct. A couple of Zsiemsk migrants saw a Stas-Rajko stopped in the street, painted just like this: muddy brown. Murdered the driver on the spot.\"",
		"The lieutenant shrugs. \"The perps were remorseful. Their *sorry* knocked eight years off the sentence. That's the system.\"",
		"\"That's... Well, yes. Exactly it, more or less. Except it was a crowd of them. Tore him out of the vehicle and ran him over with his own tyres.\"",
		"\"Could it be another Stas-Rajko murder?\" He gives you a crooked smile. \"You really should ask me to brief you on the case. But right now I'm just gonna go ahead and guess the two aren't related.\"",
		"\"They said it was an honour killing. Hussar-style. The Zsiemsk community protested the trial, flying the banners of some old king or whatever.\" He shakes his head. \"Five thousand came to protest.\"",
		"\"Yes, detective?\"",
		"\"Okay.\" The lieutenant takes his glasses off to polish. \"I'm not going to honour kill anyone over this -- but I've *seen* it blue and white. It's much better that way.\"",
		"\"I try to avoid drawing far-gone conclusions like this before actually examining the body,\" the lieutenant says with a slight smirk. \"But my initial guess is the two are unrelated.\"",
		"\"People we're paid to protect.\" The lieutenant shakes his head. \"Let's leave it at that.\"",
		"The usually unflappable lieutenant takes a surprised step back. \"Officer... what are you doing?\"",
		"\"The Coalition,\" says the lieutenant. \"But that was a long time ago. I think we should move on. It's chilly up here.\"",
		"\"We might find her down *somewhere* -- there's an old storm drain system beneath Martinaise that's mostly collapsed. Revachol's sewage system has been built and rebuilt four or five times now.\"",
		"He puts his glasses back on. \"In conclusion -- she could be under any building.\"",
		"He looks into the slit and sighs. \"I hope not.\"",
		"\"No idea.\" He takes his glasses off to polish. \"Could be connected to one of the buildings around here...\"",
		"\"Well enough, actually. It's odd how that works. I'm no sharpshooter, but I pass my shooting courses 7 out of 10.\"",
		"\"No.\" He shakes his head. The windows rattle in their frames. \"I won't even try. You know...\" He takes his glasses off.",
		"\"I had a partner once. They called him Eyes, because he had to show me things. It's that bad.\"",
		"\"The suspect? God, I hope not -- I can't see a way in...\" He inspects the bars. \"Though many have tried.\"",
		"The lieutenant looks over your shoulder.",
		"\"I see. Another stop on your crusade against narcomania. I *was* hoping we were in pursuit of a murder suspect...\"",
		"The lieutenant leans back against the door, panting. \"Let's take a breather and try this again later? It's... very tough.\"",
		"\"Given that this isn't a martial arts thriller,\" a grin flickers across his face, \"it's highly unlikely -- and not without risk to our health either.\"",
		"\"However, the pipe suggests there may be an entrance to the basement around...\" The lieutenant pushes aside the reeds and looks around.",
		"\"...and it's right here! A maintenance door.\" He points to a rusted metal double door to the right of the pipe, obscured by the reeds.",
		"\"Good work.\" The lieutenant nods toward the impenetrable darkness inside. \"Shall we?\"",
		"\"Damnit, detective. Give me the piss-jacket.\"",
		"\"The 'cool-factor' might hit me later.\" The lieutenant fingers the brown studded lapels. \"Right now it feels like a joke gone too far.\"",
		"With a look of utter disbelief the lieutenant slips into the jacket...",
		"\"Mhm. This is one of those times where you're just going to keep talking no matter what I say, isn't it?\"",
		"\"You mean any more than I already am?\" He looks around. \"We better solve this case *fast* officer. I'm not 100% comfortable with this.\"",
		"A long moment passes as the lieutenant considers his words.",
		"\"Yes, you're really showing off that... aggressive slogan there.\"",
		"\"That's not what I was saying, detective.\"",
		"\"The odds are *very high*, officer. It's situations like this that make me afraid I'll end up being the cretin-cop with 'Pissf****t' on his back...\"",
		"\"The odds are *quite* high,\" the lieutenant replies, rubbing his forehead. \"It doesn't care if we're in leather jackets that say 'Fuck the World' and 'Pissf****t' on their backs...\"",
		"\"Let's be clear about one thing. The first chance I get, this thing's coming off. And that will be it -- no take-backs, no 'follow-up conversations', that's it. Do you understand?\"",
		"\"Alright, Fuck,\" the lieutenant turns to you. \"Time to solve a murder, as counter-intuitive as it might seem in these jackets. Let's go.\"",
		"\"I know exactly what you're trying to do, detective, and it's *not* going to work.\"",
		"He sighs. \"I'm afraid the RCM is going to have our asses for this.\"",
		"\"It's...\" the lieutenant slowly shakes his head, \"not a good look. Doesn't exactly signal shit-together-ness.\"",
		"\"The problem is...\" the lieutenant says, glancing at the lapels, sleeves, and studs, \"it really *does* look cool to have both of these jackets on right now.\"",
		"\"Detective... what are you talking about?\"",
		"\"I agree. Fortunately we have plenty of work to occupy us. Let's get back to it.\"",
		"\"That's what I'm afraid of,\" he mumbles. More to himself than anyone else. \"We better solve this thing fast.\"",
		"\"Never has anyone asked me to place more trust in them than you're asking of me, right now. If you saw this branch out from under me while I've got 'Pissf****t' written on my back...\"",
		"\"Alright, that was fun. But not really,\" he adds, slipping back into his familiar bomber. \"Enough time wasted. Let's get back to work.\"",
		"\"...\"",
		"\"I can't believe you talked me into this,\" he mumbles. \"We better solve this thing fast.\"",
		"\"I disagree,\" he says with a small nod. \"In fact if we were to do a poll right now, a little 'who looks like shit'-poll, I'm fairly confident you'd come out on top.\"",
		"\"Very rock and roll, but is now really the time?\"",
		"\"I'm not sure what got you on this *pleasure wheel kick*, but I'm not going to ask any more about it.\"",
		"\"I was always too small to be allowed on board. The harness didn't work. And by the time I was finally tall enough, the wheel had fallen apart.\" He laughs and shakes his head. \"But anyway...\"",
		"\"Perhaps not *fun*, but I do think he was trying to make himself feel better, yes. In his own way.\"",
		"\"But all of us are trying to make it feel alright -- even if just for a moment. I don't think he came here to die.\" He stares at the empty bench, then shivers.",
		"\"Mr. Méjean?\" His gaze moves to the empty bench underneath the street lamp. It looks cold and uninviting, wet from the waves.",
		"\"We should get going. It's getting cold just standing here.\"",
		"\"The what now?\" The lieutenant studies your face.",
		"\"Mhmh.\" The lieutenant squints. \"What is going on with you, detective?\"",
		"\"See what?\" The lieutenant looks around uncomfortably.",
		"\"Detective...\" He puts his hand on your shoulder. \"It's been a hard week. I don't think standing here for much longer is going to do either of us any good.\"",
		"\"We should get moving. Running gets the endorphines going, no?\" He smiles at his own remark, then takes in the damp air.",
		"\"But I don't think standing here in the cold is doing you or me any good. Let's go. We've got a case to solve.\"",
		"\"The man we found?\" He realises that neither of you knows his name. \"Yes, I don't know... We didn't learn much about him, did we?\"",
		"\"The one that Mr. Heidelstam mentioned?\" The lieutenant studies your face.",
		"\"It's getting cold just standing here. I wouldn't mind if we moved around again -- maybe even had a little run.\"",
		"\"What are you looking at?\" The lieutenant follows your gaze, but finds nothing but the horizon.",
		"\"Well, here's a secret -- I've never been on an amusement ride. There used to be one in Couron, a small one when I was a kid...\" He stares right ahead, as if picturing the rickety wheel in a local marketplace, surrounded by kids.",
		"\"I don't even want to know what happened here...\"",
		"\"Huh?\"",
		"\"You didn't just win. *No one* I know has ever beaten Gurdi's Goats. That is a monumental achievement, detective.\"",
		"\"I am. I've seen it before. Played it too. You will eventually make a mistake -- and then it's all over.\"",
		"\"A little.\"",
		"\"Oh, great.\" The lieutenant sighs.",
		"\"That's amazing,\" the lieutenant mumbles. He sounds a little out of breath.",
		"\"The pinball machine?\" The lieutenant glances at the machine. \"Gurdi's Goats. A classic.\"",
		"“Those are professional tempo runners. They’re paid four figures *per* game. I meant normal human beings.”",
		"\"I feel sorry for the goats. If they only knew the kind of guy old Cornelius really was...\"",
		"\"Congratulations, your highness,\" the lieutenant replies. His knuckles touch yours and he smiles. \"That was really impressive.\"",
		"\"Congratulations.\" The lieutentant nods. \"This is where the game ends. It's a cheap way of getting more money out of the players. A stupid, nihilistic finale.\"",
		"\"The kind of a guy who uses the word 'savages' a lot when recounting his travels. A Mesque nationalist.\"",
		"\"An avid huntsman too,\" the lieutenant adds. \"He was often photographed in his dining hall, surrounded by wall-mounted hunting trophies from every continent.\"",
		"\"The machine needs a good service before anyone else can even attempt it again.\"",
		"\"Of course.\" He nods. \"I still think you earned the right to be at least a little proud.\"",
		"\"Mhmh, I've been wondering the same.\"",
		"\"Yes.\" The lieutenant gives 'CORNELIUS GURDI AND THE MOUNTAIN GOATS' one last look. \"Good times.\"",
		"\"But you seem to be having fun?\" He nods at the machine.",
		"\"He also hit his wife. And kids. Other people's kids too. Sometimes pets. Hateful little man.\"",
		"\"My glasses,\" he asks, looking  over the frames.",
		"\"My glasses,\" he asks, looking  over the frames.",
		"\"My glasses,\" he asks, looking  over the frames.",
		"\"I know.\" He looks at the city below. \"Let's move.\"",
		"\"My glasses,\" he asks, looking  over the frames.",
		"\"My glasses,\" he asks, looking  over the frames.",
		"\"Yes,\" the lieutenant agrees. It's a good tradeoff.\"",
		"\"My glasses,\" he asks, looking  over the frames.",
		"\"My glasses,\" he asks, looking  over the frames.",
		"\"My glasses,\" he asks, looking  over the frames.",
		"\"My glasses,\" he asks, looking  over the frames.",
		"\"Yes,\" the lieutenant agrees. It's a good tradeoff.\"",
		"\"My glasses,\" he asks, looking  over the frames.",
		"\"My glasses,\" he asks, looking  over the frames.",
		"\"If by 'glasses' you mean us, then yes,\" he pretends to  agree. \"We do really need  to go.\" Back to work.",
		"\"If by 'glasses' you mean us, then yes,\" he pretends to  agree. \"We do really need  to go.\" Back to work.",
		"\"My glasses,\" he asks, looking  over the frames.",
		"\"My glasses,\" he asks, looking  over the frames.",
		"\"My glasses,\" he asks, looking  over the frames.",
		"\"My glasses,\" he asks, looking  over the frames.",
		"\"Very funny. What do you want?\"",
		"\"Isn't it always party time with you?\"",
		"\"Well, I don't know either. You should get some rest.\"",
		"\"Bad dreams?\"",
		"\"Yes, that's a good idea. Let's do it in the morning. You know, when we're not sleeping.\"",
		"\"To clear our heads from what, *sleep*?\"",
		"\"What is it, officer?\" The lieutenant's voice sounds tired.",
		"\"You'll get used to them, I promise. Sometimes it helps to go for a short walk.\"",
		"\"Is that you, detective?\"",
		"\"Good night, detective.\"",
		"\"Yes, what is it? What time is it?\""
